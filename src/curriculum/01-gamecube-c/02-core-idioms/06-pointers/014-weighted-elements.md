title: Scaling One Element Before Combining
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - loads
  - arrays
  - multiplication
  - chaining
symbol: weight
hints:
  - One loaded element is multiplied by a constant before being combined with
    another.
  - "Look for `mulli rD, rA, n` between the loads and the combine — the `n` is
    the literal multiplier."

# Pointer reads meet integer arithmetic

In a register, an array element is nothing special, just an integer, and
everything from the Integer Arithmetic chapter still applies. Here the work is
small. An element gets loaded, multiplied by some constant, and added to a
neighbour. When the constant isn't a power of two the compiler can't shift, so
it reaches for `mulli rD, rA, n` (*multiply low immediate*) and parks the
multiplier `n` inside the instruction itself. Powers of two stay the exception,
folding down to a `slwi` the way they did in those earlier lessons.

`blend(q)` is a good example. Three elements come in, the middle one gets scaled
by 5, and the three are combined:

```asm
lwz   r0, 4(r3)    # q[1]
lwz   r4, 0(r3)    # q[0]
mulli r0, r0, 5    # q[1] * 5
lwz   r3, 12(r3)   # q[3]   (displacement 12 / 4 = index 3)
add   r0, r4, r0   # q[0] + q[1]*5
subf  r3, r3, r0   # r0 - q[3]
blr
```

Loads gather the elements. `mulli` handles the scale. The running total flows
through `add` and `subf`. To recover the C, read the assembly backwards. Each
displacement becomes an index, and the `mulli` immediate becomes the multiplier.
Your target wears the same load-scale-combine shape, only with different indices,
a different multiplier, and a different combine at the end.

## Your task

Write `weight`, taking one `int*`, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int weight(int* p) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int weight(int* p) {
    return p[0] * 3 + p[2];
}
```
