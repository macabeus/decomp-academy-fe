title: The Anatomy of a Counted Loop
difficulty: 1
concepts:
  - for-loop
  - induction-variable
  - control-flow
symbol: sum
hints:
  - Declare an accumulator `s = 0` and an induction variable `i`.
  - A standard `for (i = 0; i < n; i++) s += i;` is exactly this skeleton.
  - The leading `b` to the test means a zero-or-negative `n` runs the body zero
    times.

# A loop is just a backward branch

Up to now control has only flowed downhill toward `blr`. A loop bends that line
back on itself with a single **branch that jumps backwards**, letting the same
instructions run more than once. Watch how MWCC threads a `for` loop. You enter
at a `b` that skips ahead to the comparison; the comparison decides whether any
work remains, and when it passes, control drops into the body. The body runs,
bumps the counter, and lands back on that same comparison. Since the test is the
first thing reached, the body can run zero times when the count begins empty.
That early check is why people call the loop **pre-tested** even though the
compare physically sits at the bottom; the jump-first wiring just makes it behave
as if the test came first.

Take `squares(n)`, which totals the integers from 1 up through `n`:

```asm
li   r0, 0          # s = 0
li   r4, 1          # i = 1
b    test           # jump straight to the test (pre-test)
body:
add  r0, r0, r4     # s += i
addi r4, r4, 1      # i++
test:
cmpw r4, r3         # i <= n ?
ble+ body           # if so, go round again
mr   r3, r0         # return s
blr
```

The counter driving all this, `i` over in `r4`, is the loop's **induction
variable**. And notice where the test lands, down at the bottom, reached first by
way of that leading `b`, which is exactly why an `n` under 1 leaves the body
untouched. Your own `sum` counts from 0 rather than 1 and quits one short of `n`
instead of including it, so its starting value and its test won't match the ones
here.

## Your task

Write `sum`, returning the sum `0 + 1 + ... + (n-1)`.

<!-- starter -->
```c
#pragma optimization_level 1
int sum(int n) {
    // accumulate 0 + 1 + ... + (n-1)
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
#pragma optimization_level 1
int sum(int n) {
    int i, s = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) s += i;
    return s;
}
```
