  - Two different return values force a `cmpw` plus a branch.
  - Expect `cmpw`, a speculative `li r3, 20`, then `bnelr-`.

# When a comparison drives control flow

Two different return values, one per arm of an `if`/`else`. That's all it takes
to summon your first genuine **compare-and-branch**. The comparison quits handing
you a number. It sets the condition register, and a branch reads that register to
choose a direction.

```asm
cmpw  r3, r4      # compare a and b, set cr0
li    r3, 20      # speculative load of one return value
bnelr-            # conditional return
li    r3, 10      # fall-through: load the other return value
blr
```

Quick warning about `bnelr-`. The trailing `-` is a branch-prediction hint, not
an operand, so peel it off in your head. What's left is worth dwelling on. MWCC
loads `20` speculatively, before the branch knows a thing, betting it'll stick.
And `bnelr` is a conditional return, "branch to link register if not equal", a
single instruction standing in for the entire else.

Trace it. `cmpw` sets cr0. The first `li` plants a guess. The conditional return
bails on the spot or drops through, and on the drop-through the second `li`
overwrites that guess. Watch the branch mnemonic above all else. Where the early
exit fires is what nails each `li` to its arm.

## Your task

Write `pick`, taking two `int`s, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int pick(int a, int b) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int pick(int a, int b) {
    if (a == b) return 10;
    else return 20;
}
```
