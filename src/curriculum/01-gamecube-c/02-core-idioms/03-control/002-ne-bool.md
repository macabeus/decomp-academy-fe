title: Not-Equal Is Its Own Idiom
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - comparison
  - boolean
  - idiom
symbol: not_equal
hints:
  - Inequality uses two subtractions ORed together.
  - The sign bit is harvested with `srwi r3, r0, 31`.

# Inequality flips the recipe

Last lesson, equality used `cntlzw` to spot a zero result. Inequality wants the
opposite, a non-zero result, and it needs its own trick to get there. MWCC
subtracts the two inputs *both ways round*, ORs the pair, and then keeps only the
top bit of what comes out.

```asm
subf r5, r3, r4    # one direction
subf r0, r4, r3    # the other direction
or   r0, r5, r0    # combine
srwi r3, r0, 31    # pull bit 31 down to 0/1
blr
```

Why both directions? Because that pair of subtractions guarantees bit 31 is set
the moment the inputs differ. At least one of the two will overflow into that
bit. When the inputs match, both differences are zero and so is the OR. The
closing `srwi r3, r0, 31` then drags bit 31 down to a tidy `0` or `1`. There's a
corner case that still behaves: if one difference wraps to `INT_MIN`, the other
wraps to `INT_MIN` as well, the OR stays `INT_MIN`, bit 31 stays lit, and the
answer holds.

## Your task

Write `not_equal`, taking two `int`s, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int not_equal(int a, int b) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int not_equal(int a, int b) {
    return a != b;
}
```
