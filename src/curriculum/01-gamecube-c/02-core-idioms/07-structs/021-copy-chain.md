title: Combining a Copy With a Field Update
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - structs
  - copy
  - write
  - chaining
symbol: Mob_respawn
hints:
  - First a member-to-member copy (loads from one set of offsets, stores to
    another, all off the same base pointer), then a separate write to a scalar
    field.
  - Split the assembly into the copy block and the trailing field write; each half
    is a technique you have already used.

# Chaining a struct copy with another step

Real functions rarely copy a struct and stop. This lesson combines two techniques
you have already met — a **struct copy** and a plain **field write** — back to
back in one body. A struct copy can also happen between two *members of the same
object*: `obj->a = obj->b` copies one sub-struct over another, with both the loads
and the stores hanging off the same base pointer at different offsets.

Consider an entity that snaps its velocity back to a saved value and then bumps a
counter:

```c
typedef struct { f32 x; f32 y; f32 z; } Vec3;
typedef struct { Vec3 vel; Vec3 origin; s32 frame; } Particle;

void Particle_reset(Particle* p) {
    p->vel = p->origin;
    p->frame += 1;
}
```

```asm
lwz   r4, 12(r3)    # origin.x   (origin starts at offset 12)
lwz   r0, 16(r3)    # origin.y
stw   r4, 0(r3)     # vel.x      (vel starts at offset 0)
stw   r0, 4(r3)     # vel.y
lwz   r0, 20(r3)    # origin.z
stw   r0, 8(r3)     # vel.z
lwz   r4, 24(r3)    # frame
addi  r0, r4, 1     # frame + 1
stw   r0, 24(r3)    # frame = frame + 1
blr
```

Two steps sit side by side. The six `lwz`/`stw` that read `origin` (offsets
12/16/20) and write `vel` (offsets 0/4/8) are the **member copy** `p->vel =
p->origin` — note both halves use the single base pointer `r3`, because source and
destination live in the same object. The trailing `lwz`/`addi`/`stw` on offset 24
is the separate **field update** `p->frame += 1`. Mentally split the copy block
from the scalar tail and each piece is something you have done before.

The target does the same kind of thing — a member copy followed by one scalar
field update (read its tail carefully; the second step is not the same operation
shown above). Pull the two apart, then write both.

## Your task

With the `Mob` struct above, write `Mob_respawn` to reproduce the target
assembly.

<!-- starter -->
```c
void Mob_respawn(Mob* m) {
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
void Mob_respawn(Mob* m) {
    m->pos = m->home;
    m->hp = 100;
}
```

<!-- context -->
```c
typedef struct { f32 x; f32 y; f32 z; } Vec3;
typedef struct { Vec3 pos; Vec3 home; s32 hp; } Mob;
```
