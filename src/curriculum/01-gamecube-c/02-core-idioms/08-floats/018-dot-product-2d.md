title: Two Products Summed — the 2D Dot Product
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - floating-point
  - fmadds
  - dot-product
  - chaining
symbol: dot2
hints:
  - One product is a standalone `fmuls`; the second product and the sum fuse
    into a single `fmadds`.
  - Read the `fmuls` operands and the `fmadds` multiply operands to pair up which
    arguments multiply together.

# A sum of two products

Two products added together. You see this shape everywhere, a 2D dot product, a
determinant, a complex multiply. On the face of it that is two multiplies and an
add, but only one `fmuls` actually shows up, because the *second* product gets
folded into the add by `fmadds`.

Take `cross(p, q, r, s)`, which works out `p*r + q*s`:

```asm
fmuls  f0, f2, f4    # f0 = q * s      (one product, standalone)
fmadds f1, f1, f3, f0 # f1 = p*r + f0  =  p*r + q*s
blr
```

Here the compiler did `q*s` first, as the standalone `fmuls`, then swept `p*r`
and the running sum into a single `fmadds`. (Same form as ever, `fmadds fD, fA,
fC, fB` = `fA*fC + fB`.) Which product lands in the lone `fmuls` versus which
rides along in the `fmadds` is up to the compiler and not worth fighting. What
you care about is the operand registers, since they tell you *which two arguments
multiply together*. The four floats come in across `f1`–`f4`.

Your target wears the same `fmuls` → `fmadds` skeleton. Read the operand
registers, pull out the two products, and check that they are added.

## Your task

Write `dot2`, taking four `f32`s, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
f32 dot2(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c, f32 d) {
    return 0.0f;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
f32 dot2(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c, f32 d) {
    return a * b + c * d;
}
```
