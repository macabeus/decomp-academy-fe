# One instruction for multiply-then-add

PowerPC can multiply and add in one shot, rounding only once. It's called a **fused multiply-add**. Since `fp_contract` is **on** here, MWCC happily collapses a multiply that feeds an add into a single **`fmadds`**.

Say three `f32` arguments `p`, `q`, `r` arrive in `f1`, `f2`, `f3`:

```asm
fmadds f1, f1, f2, f3   # one rounding, single precision
blr
```

Operand order is the part that bites you. `fmadds fD, fA, fC, fB` means `fD = (fA * fC) + fB`, so `fmadds f1, f1, f2, f3` multiplies `f1` by `f2` and adds `f3`. The middle two get multiplied; the last is the addend.

Learn to spot this one. Split it back into a separate `fmuls` and `fadds` and you'll miss a contracted target, and the reverse fails just as surely. Its double-precision twin drops the `s` to become `fmadd`, and the neighbors are `fmsubs` (`a*b - c`), `fnmadds`, and `fnmsubs`.

Back to the target for `fma3`. Its arguments sit in `f1`, `f2`, `f3`. Match those to `a`, `b`, `c`, walk the operand order, and you'll know which pair is multiplied and which value rides along as the addend.

## Your task

Write `fma3` taking three `f32`s so it compiles to the `fmadds` above. Write it
as a plain expression — let the compiler fuse it.

<!-- starter -->
```c
f32 fma3(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c) {
    return 0.0f;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
f32 fma3(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c) {
    return a * b + c;
}
```
