# An explicit cast can be a whole instruction

Not every cast is free. Push a wide signed value *down* into a narrower signed
type and then let it widen back, and the value has to be squeezed through that
narrow range, so it gets sign-extended from the cast's width on the way out.

Here is a function that narrows an `int` into the range of a signed halfword:

```asm
extsh r3, r3        # narrow to s16 width, sign bit re-spread
blr
```

What **`extsh`** (*extend sign halfword*) does is hold onto the low 16 bits and
copy bit 15 up across the top 16, so the register ends up holding a properly
sign-extended 32-bit value. Drop down a width and you get **`extsb`** (*extend
sign byte*), which does the same trick from bit 7 across the top 24:

```asm
extsb r3, r3        # narrow to s8 width, sign bit re-spread
blr
```

When you spot a stray `extsb` or `extsh` on its own in the disassembly, it has
usually come from an explicit narrowing cast in the source rather than from a
load.

## Your task

Write `as_s8` so it compiles to the single `extsb` above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int as_s8(int x) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int as_s8(int x) {
    return (s8)x;
}
```
