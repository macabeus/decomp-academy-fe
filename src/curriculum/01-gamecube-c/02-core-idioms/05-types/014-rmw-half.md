title: A Signed Halfword Read-Modify-Write
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - loads
  - stores
  - read-modify-write
  - signed
  - sign-extension
symbol: rmw_half
hints:
  - "A *signed* halfword read-modify-write loads with `lha` (it sign-extends),
    not `lhz`."
  - The store is `sth`; like every store it just truncates to width, so the sign
    handling lives entirely in the *load*.

# Sign lives in the load, width lives in the store

Push the read-modify-write up to halfword width and let the value be signed. Same
three beats as before, load then modify then store, but the type drags two of the
instructions along with it. A `s16` is signed, so the load has to carry the sign
upward, and that makes it `lha`, the algebraic load, rather than `lhz`. On the way
out it is `sth`, the halfword store, truncating the way every store does.

Say `quad(p)` takes the signed halfword at `p[0]` and quadruples it. Since 4 is a
power of two, the compiler trades the multiply for a left shift, `slwi`:

```asm
lha   r0, 0(r3)   # load p[0], sign-extended (s16 is signed)
slwi  r0, r0, 2   # * 4  (shift left by 2)
sth   r0, 0(r3)   # truncate back to a halfword
blr
```

Worth burning into memory is where each responsibility sits. Signedness rides on
the load, `lha` against `lhz`; the arithmetic plays out in a roomy 32-bit
register; and width is the store's only concern, since `sth` simply keeps the
bottom 16 bits and could not care less about the sign. Read the same location
back later through a signed pointer and that later load sign-extends all over
again. The store never did.

Your target reaches for a different operation than the worked example does. Find
whatever sits between the `lha` and the `sth`, and read its operand straight off.

## Your task

Write `rmw_half`, taking an `s16*`, to match the target assembly. The load must
be `lha` and the store `sth`.

<!-- starter -->
```c
void rmw_half(s16* p) {
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
void rmw_half(s16* p) {
    p[0] = p[0] + 100;
}
```
