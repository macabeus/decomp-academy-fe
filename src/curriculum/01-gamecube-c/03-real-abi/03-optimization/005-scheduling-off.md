title: "#pragma scheduling off: Freezing the Order"
difficulty: 4
concepts:
  - scheduling
  - pragma
  - ordering
symbol: combine3
hints:
  - "Same body as the very first lesson: two sums, then multiply them."
  - The pragma forces source order, so each `add` follows its own pair of loads.
  - Keep the `#pragma scheduling off`/`reset` lines untouched.

# Putting the instructions back in source order

That pragma has a twin, `scheduling off`. Switch it on and MWCC stops reordering
for latency, writing instructions out in more or less the order you typed them.
So the loads-first shape from before never shows up in a target built this way.
Loads end up wedged right against whatever consumes them.

Here's lesson 1's body again, two sums and a multiply, except this time
scheduling is off.

```asm
lwz   r4, 0(r3)
lwz   r0, 4(r3)
add   r5, r4, r0    # a computed immediately after its loads
lwz   r4, 8(r3)
lwz   r0, 12(r3)
add   r0, r4, r0    # b computed immediately after its loads
mullw r3, r5, r0
```

See how the four loads never get gathered up front. Each pair stays welded to its
own `add`, and that ordering, plus the register numbers it drags along, is the
tell for `scheduling off`. Peephole worked the same way. You bracket the region
and you always close an `off` with a `reset`, and in real decomp the two pragmas
tend to travel together around an entire function.

## Your task

Write the body of `combine3(int *p)` to match the un-batched, source-order
assembly above. Read which array slots pair with which `add`, and what the
final `mullw` combines. With scheduling off the compiler emits in source order,
so the layout of the loads tells you the layout of the C.

<!-- starter -->
```c
#pragma scheduling off
int combine3(int *p) {
    return 0;
}
#pragma scheduling reset
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
#pragma scheduling off
int combine3(int *p) {
    int a = p[0] + p[1];
    int b = p[2] + p[3];
    return a * b;
}
#pragma scheduling reset
```
