title: Indexing a Global Array
difficulty: 4
concepts:
  - globals
  - array
  - addr16
  - lwzx
  - scaled-index
symbol: getScore
hints:
  - Array base via the @ha/@l pair, index scaled by the element size, then an
    indexed load.
  - "`gScores[i]` becomes `lis @ha`, `slwi r0, r3, 2`, `addi @l`, `lwzx r3, r3,
    r0`."

# Base address plus a scaled index

`tbl[i]` from a global array is two ideas you've already met, bolted together.
Build the address, then run a **scaled, indexed load**. Arrays don't sit in small
data, so the base is still the `@ha`/`@l` pair. Scale `i` by the element size and
let `lwzx` ("load word zero, indexed") grab the element off base-plus-index:

```asm
lis   r4, tbl@ha        # high half of &tbl
slwi  r0, r3, 2         # r0 = i * 4   (sizeof(int) == 4)
addi  r3, r4, tbl@l     # r3 = &tbl  (add low half)
lwzx  r3, r3, r0        # r3 = *(&tbl + i*4) = tbl[i]
blr
```
```
R_PPC_ADDR16_HA   tbl
R_PPC_ADDR16_LO   tbl
```

`slwi r0, r3, 2` shifts left by 2. That's a multiply by 4, which is the size of
an `int`. After it, `lwzx rD, rA, rB` reads from `rA + rB`, the base plus that
scaled offset, no displacement field anywhere. And those two `R_PPC_ADDR16`
relocations give it away as a global array rather than a small-data scalar.

One detail worth a second look. The `slwi` sits *between* the `lis` and the
`addi`, even though it has no part in forming the base. That's scheduling, not
meaning. Its scaling doesn't depend on the address pair, so MWCC drops it into
the gap to hide the `lis` latency. Real CodeWarrior output reorders things like
this constantly, so don't read anything into it.

## Your task

`extern int gScores[];` is provided. Write `getScore`, taking an `int i`, so it
compiles to the indexed array load above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int getScore(int i) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int getScore(int i) {
    return gScores[i];
}
```

<!-- context -->
```c
extern int gScores[];
```
