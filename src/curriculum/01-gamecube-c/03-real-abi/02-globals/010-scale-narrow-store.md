title: "Read Wide, Store Narrow"
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - globals
  - sda21
  - types
  - stb
  - chaining
symbol: clampLevel
hints:
  - "`lwz` reads the int global; a `mulli` scales it; the store opcode is the one
    that matches the *destination* global's width."
  - The compiler never masks before a narrow store - `stb` writes only the low
    byte on its own, so the source value's extra bits are simply dropped.
---

# The store width follows the destination, not the source

Read a wide global, run some arithmetic, then write into a *narrower* global, and
the two memory opcodes end up coming from different types. The load is `lwz`,
because the source happens to be an `int`. The store is `stb` (or `sth`), because
the *destination* is a byte (or halfword). Nothing in between narrows the value
for you. A `stb` already keeps only the low 8 bits, so the upper part of the
computed word just drops on the floor.

It's the same narrow-store rule from the type lesson, `stb`/`sth` and all, except
now it follows arithmetic rather than a plain load. The *store* opcode hands you
the destination's width, and the *load* opcode hands you the source's.

Here's `stepPhase()`. It reads the int global `gTicks`, multiplies by a constant,
and drops the low byte into the `u8` global `gPhase`:

```asm
lwz   r0, gTicks@sda21(r13)  # read int global gTicks
mulli r0, r0, 5             # gTicks * 5  (constant multiply, not a power of two)
stb   r0, gPhase@sda21(r13)  # gPhase = (u8) result
blr
```

`mulli` is the catch-all constant multiply, and 5 isn't a power of two, so
there's no shift to strength-reduce it into. That product fills the whole of
`r0`, and yet `stb` writes back only the low byte to the `u8` global, which *is*
the `(u8)` cast made flesh. Your target scales a different int global by a
different constant ahead of its own narrow store. The `mulli` immediate and the
store opcode are what you read off it.

## Your task

The globals are declared for you: `gRaw` (`int`) and `gLevel` (`u8`). Write
`clampLevel` (no arguments, no return) to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
void clampLevel(void) {
    // read the int global, scale it, store the low byte into the u8 global
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
void clampLevel(void) {
    gLevel = (u8)(gRaw * 3);
}
```

<!-- context -->
```c
extern int gRaw;
extern u8 gLevel;
```
