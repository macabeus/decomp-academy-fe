title: Volatile Hardware Registers
difficulty: 4
concepts:
  - volatile
  - hardware-register
  - vu32
  - memory-mapped
symbol: read_status
hints:
  - Cast the fixed address through `vu32` (volatile u32) so each dereference is
    a real load.
  - Expect `lis r3, 0xCC00` then two `lwz r?, 0x3000(r3)` — the volatile
    prevents merging them.

# Reading a memory-mapped register

The GameCube wires its hardware into the address space, so a block of fixed
addresses up in the `0xCC000000` range act as memory-mapped registers whose
reads return whatever the device is doing right now. To get at one you cast its
address through a `volatile` pointer, which is what the `vu32` typedef
(`volatile u32`) is for. That `volatile` is doing real work here, because if
you dropped it the compiler would CSE two reads of the register into a single
load and you would never see whatever changed in between.

So two reads of the same register stay two reads in the output. The example
below reads `0xCC005000`, the DMA controller, twice and adds the two results
together.

```asm
lis r3, -13312       # build the high half of the address (0xCC000000)
lwz r0, 20480(r3)   # first read of the register (0x5000 = 20480)
lwz r3, 20480(r3)   # second read — volatile keeps it
add r3, r0, r3
blr
```

The `lis` builds the upper 16 bits of the address and the `lwz` displacement
supplies the lower half. One detail trips people up. objdump shows the `lis`
immediate as a signed `-13312`, because the bit pattern `0xCC00` reads as
`52224` unsigned but as `-13312` when interpreted as a signed 16-bit value, and
`lis` shifts whichever it is left by 16 to land on `0xCC000000`, with the
displacement filling in the rest. Either way, every access goes back out to the
device. When you see the same fixed address loaded again and again with no
store in between, you are looking at code polling a hardware register, and the
way to bring it back is to cast that address through a `volatile` pointer.

## Your task

Write `read_status` to match the assembly above. The `vu32` typedef is part
of the shared preamble. Both loads must survive as separate `lwz`.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int read_status(void) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int read_status(void) {
    int a = *(vu32*)0xCC003000;
    int b = *(vu32*)0xCC003000;
    return a + b;
}
```
