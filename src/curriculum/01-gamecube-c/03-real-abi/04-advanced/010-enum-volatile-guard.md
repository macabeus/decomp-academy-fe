title: "Chain: Enum Guard, Then a Volatile Sum"
difficulty: 4
concepts:
  - enum
  - volatile
  - cse
  - guard
  - chaining
symbol: sample
hints:
  - The enum field load + `cmpwi K` + `bnelr-` is a one-line guard; the `li r3,-1`
    is parked speculatively before the compare so the bail value is already in
    place.
  - Past the guard, the volatile global is read twice — two `lwz` of the same
    @sda21 symbol with no store between — and summed.

# A typed gate in front of a volatile read

Engine code often refuses to touch hardware until the object is in the right
state. What you get is two idioms back to back. First an `enum` state check, the
kind from lesson 5, acts as an early-return guard, and only when that guard
passes does the function reach a `volatile` access that defeats CSE, the kind
from lesson 6. To read the assembly, split it at the conditional branch, since
everything ahead of the branch is the guard and everything past it is the
actual work.

Take `read_if_armed(struct Sensor *s)`, which bails out with a sentinel unless
`s->state` is the enum value `ARMED` (ordinal 1), and otherwise reads a
`volatile int g_raw` twice.

```asm
lwz   r0, 0(r3)            # load the 4-byte enum field
li    r3, -1              # park the bail value speculatively...
cmpwi r0, 1               # ...is state == ARMED (ordinal 1)?
bnelr-                    # no -> return r3 (= -1) right here
lwz   r3, g_raw@sda21(r2) # yes: first volatile read
lwz   r0, g_raw@sda21(r2) # second read — volatile, not CSE'd
add   r3, r3, r0
blr
```

The guard is that `lwz`/`cmpwi K`/`bnelr-` trio. It loads the enum field,
compares it against an ordinal, and `bnelr-` returns straight away when the two
differ, with the sentinel already waiting in `r3` thanks to the speculative
`li`. One thing worth knowing is that the sentinel needs to be non-zero, because
a `return 0` arm lets MWCC flatten the guard into a branchless mask and the
`bnelr-` disappears. Once you are past the branch, the two `lwz` of the same
`@sda21` symbol with nothing storing between them is the volatile double-read
fingerprint, where a plain `int` would have loaded once and done
`add r3, r0, r0`.

## Your task

Write `sample(struct Dev *d)` to reproduce the assembly above. The `Mode` enum,
`Dev` struct, and the `volatile int g_ticks` are provided in context. Read the
`cmpwi` immediate to find which enum value passes the guard and the `li` to find
the sentinel; the global must be read twice past the guard.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int sample(struct Dev *d) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int sample(struct Dev *d) {
    if (d->mode != MODE_HIGH) return -1;
    return g_ticks + g_ticks;
}
```

<!-- context -->
```c
typedef enum { MODE_OFF, MODE_LOW, MODE_HIGH } Mode;
struct Dev { Mode mode; };
extern volatile int g_ticks;
```
