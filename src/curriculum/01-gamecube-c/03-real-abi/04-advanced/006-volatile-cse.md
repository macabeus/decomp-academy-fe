title: "Volatile Defeats CSE: Two Reads, Two Loads"
difficulty: 4
concepts:
  - volatile
  - cse
  - optimization
  - loads
symbol: twice_vol
hints:
  - volatile forbids common-subexpression elimination, so each source read
    becomes its own load.
  - Expect two `lwz` of g_counter then `add r3, r3, r0` — a plain int would load
    once and do `add r3, r0, r0`.

# When the optimizer is forbidden to remember

At `-O4,p` MWCC is happy to fold repeated memory reads through CSE,
common-subexpression elimination. Load the same global twice with nothing
writing to it in between and the compiler loads it once, then reuses the value.
Here is a plain global `g_frame` added to itself.

```asm
lwz r0, g_frame@sda21(r2)   # ONE load...
add r3, r0, r0              # ...reused for both operands
blr
```

Now make `g_frame` a `volatile` and everything you just saw goes backwards.
Because the standard treats each access to a `volatile` as observable
behaviour, the compiler isn't free to merge two reads into one, to leave the
value parked in a register between uses, or to slide the accesses around in the
schedule, so reading the variable twice in the source genuinely costs you two
loads in the output.

```asm
lwz r3, g_frame@sda21(r2)   # first read
lwz r0, g_frame@sda21(r2)   # second read — not CSE'd
add r3, r3, r0
blr
```

Why does that matter for matching? Because a value that comes back from memory
more often than the arithmetic could possibly need, with nothing writing to it
in between, is about the most dependable sign of `volatile` you will ever get.
When your attempt collapses down to one load and the target stubbornly reloads,
the original was almost certainly `volatile`, and the same reasoning runs in the
other direction just as well. There is more to it than the load count, though,
because `volatile` also pins the instruction order that `,p` scheduling would
otherwise be free to rearrange, and that ordering guarantee is the whole reason
hardware-register code depends on it.

## Your task

Write `twice_vol` using the provided `volatile int g_counter` to reproduce the
assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int twice_vol(void) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int twice_vol(void) {
    return g_counter + g_counter;
}
```

<!-- context -->
```c
extern volatile int g_counter;
```
