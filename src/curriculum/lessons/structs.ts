# A struct is just an offset into memory

A pointer to a struct arrives in \`r3\` like any other pointer. Reading a field is
a single **load at the field's byte offset**. Given:

\`\`\`c
typedef struct { int x; int y; } Point;
\`\`\`

\`x\` lives at offset 0 and \`y\` at offset 4 (each \`int\` is 4 bytes). So
\`p->y\` is a word load four bytes past the base:

\`\`\`asm
lwz  r3, 4(r3)   # load p->y
blr
\`\`\`

That \`4(r3)\` is the whole story — \`lwz rD, off(rA)\` means "load the word at
\`rA + off\`". When you see a bare \`lwz r3, 4(r3)\`, it's tempting to read it as
\`*(int*)((char*)p + 4)\`, but that bare offset is really a clue: the original was
almost certainly a **named field** of a struct, and recovering that name and
offset is the job.

# Storing into a field

Writing a field mirrors reading it: a **store at the field's offset**. The store
instruction \`stw rS, off(rA)\` writes \`rS\` to \`rA + off\`. With:

\`\`\`c
typedef struct { int x; int y; } Point;
\`\`\`

the value to store arrives in \`r4\` (the second argument) and the struct base in
\`r3\`. Setting \`p->y = v\` is:

\`\`\`asm
stw  r4, 4(r3)   # p->y = v

No load is needed — we overwrite the whole field. The order of operands in

# The field's type picks the load

A field's C type decides both its **size** and the **load instruction**. A
\`u8\` field is loaded with \`lbz\` (load byte, zero-extend); a \`u16\` with \`lhz\`
(load halfword). Given a packed color:

\`\`\`c
typedef struct { u8 r; u8 g; u8 b; u8 a; } Color;

each byte is one wide, so \`g\` is at offset 1:

\`\`\`asm

This is a strong decompilation signal: an \`lbz\`/\`lhz\` at some offset tells you the
field there is a **\`u8\`/\`u16\`**, not an \`int\`. Use \`u8\` (not \`char\`) for a byte

\`\`\`c

Watch alignment when fields have mixed widths: a \`u16\` cannot start at an odd

# A hidden byte changes the math

The previous lesson noted it in passing; now you'll match it. A field can't sit
at *any* offset — its type forces **alignment**. A \`u16\` must start on an even
address, so in:

\`\`\`c
typedef struct { u8 tag; u16 count; } S;

\`tag\` takes offset 0, but \`count\` can't follow at offset 1 (odd). The compiler

lhz  r3, 2(r3)   # s->count, not 1(r3)

If you assume \`count\` sits at offset 1, your load reads \`1(r3)\` and never
matches. Whenever a wider field follows a narrower one, check whether alignment
pushed it forward — the gap is invisible in the C but very visible in the asm.

# Inner offsets add up

When one struct contains another, the inner fields are laid out **inline** — there
is no pointer to chase. The compiler simply **adds the offsets**. Given:

\`\`\`c
typedef struct { f32 x; f32 y; f32 z; } Vec3;
typedef struct { int id; Vec3 pos; } Entity;
\`\`\`

\`id\` is at offset 0, so \`pos\` begins at offset 4, and inside it \`y\` is one
\`f32\` (4 bytes) further along — offset 8 overall. Because it's an \`f32\`, the load
is \`lfs\` (load floating single) into a float register:

\`\`\`asm
lfs  f1, 8(r3)   # load e->pos.y
blr
\`\`\`

Two field accesses (\`pos\` then \`.y\`) collapse into a **single** \`8(r3)\`. The
arithmetic is just a sum of offsets: \`offsetof(Entity, pos) = 4\` (past the 4-byte
\`int id\`) plus \`offsetof(Vec3, y) = 4\` (past one \`f32\`), giving \`4 + 4 = 8\`. Run
that addition yourself on any nested struct and the "weird" offset stops being a

This is one of the most recognizable shapes in all of GameCube decompilation.
To find \`a[i].field\`, the compiler computes the element address as

\`f->active = 1\` loads the byte, then uses \`rlwimi\` (rotate-left-word-immediate-

inclusive mask \`MB = ME = 24\` selects exactly that one bit. Deriving each operand

\`\`\`

The \`stwu\`/\`mflr\`/\`stw\` prologue and the matching epilogue are the standard
non-leaf frame; the indirect call itself is the middle three lines. The trio
\`lwz r12, off(rX)\` → \`mtctr r12\` → \`bctrl\` is the unmistakable signature of an
**indirect call through a struct field** — a vtable dispatch or callback. The
argument \`a\` is already in \`r3\`, so no extra setup is needed before the call.

## Your task

With \`Actor\` above, write \`Actor_run\` that calls \`a->update(a)\`.
`,
    symbol: "Actor_run",
    context: `typedef struct Actor {
    int hp;
    void (*update)(struct Actor*);
} Actor;`,
    starter: `void Actor_run(Actor* a) {
}
`,
    solution: `void Actor_run(Actor* a) {
    a->update(a);
}
`,
    hints: [
      "Call the stored pointer directly: `a->update(a);`.",
      "Expect `lwz r12, 4(r3)`, `mtctr r12`, then `bctrl`.",
    ],
  },
