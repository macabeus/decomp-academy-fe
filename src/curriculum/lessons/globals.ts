    brief: `
# How a global is addressed

A 32-bit GameCube address won't fit in an instruction, so the compiler can't just
\`lwz\` a global by its absolute address. MWCC's answer is the **Small Data Area
(SDA)**: at startup, register **\`r13\`** is pointed at a fixed base, and frequently
used globals are gathered into a window reachable by a signed 16-bit offset from
it. That window is only 64 KB wide (±32 KB from the base), so on a large game
some globals spill out and have to be reached the longer way (the \`@ha\`/\`@l\`
addressing a few lessons from now). For anything that fits, reading one is a
single load with that offset baked in by the linker:

\`\`\`asm
lwz   r3, g@sda21(r13)   # load global g, r13-relative
blr
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
R_PPC_EMB_SDA21   g
\`\`\`

The \`@sda21\` operand is a **relocation** — in an unlinked object the disassembler
prints \`lwz r3, 0(0)\` with an attached \`R_PPC_EMB_SDA21 g\` line, because the
offset and base register aren't filled in until link time. That \`R_PPC_EMB_SDA21\`
line is the unmistakable signature of an ordinary (non-array) global. Whether the
global is \`extern\` or defined in this file, the access looks identical.

    brief: `
# Storing through the same r13 window

Writing a global is the mirror image of reading one. The value is already in a
register (here the argument \`v\` in \`r3\`), and a single **\`stw\`** stores it at the
same \`@sda21\` offset from \`r13\`:

\`\`\`asm
stw   r3, g@sda21(r13)   # g = v
blr
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
R_PPC_EMB_SDA21   g
\`\`\`

Same relocation (\`R_PPC_EMB_SDA21\`), same base register — only the opcode flips
from load (\`lwz\`) to store (\`stw\`). No address has to be materialized first;
that's the whole point of the SDA. If you ever see a bare \`stw rX, sym@sda21(r13)\`
with nothing computing an address beforehand, the C was simply \`sym = value;\`.

    concepts: ["globals", "sda21", "types", "lbz", "lhz"],
    brief: `
# Narrow globals: same SDA, different load

The \`@sda21\` addressing doesn't change with the width of the global — but the
**opcode does**, exactly the way it tracks type for any load. The relocation stays
\`R_PPC_EMB_SDA21\`; the instruction tells you the declared type:

\`\`\`asm
lbz   r3, g@sda21(r13)   # u8  global  (load byte, zero-extend)
lhz   r3, g@sda21(r13)   # u16 global  (load halfword, zero-extend)
lha   r3, g@sda21(r13)   # s16 global  (load halfword, sign-extend)
\`\`\`

For a \`u8\` global you get **\`lbz\`** (load byte zero), for \`u16\` **\`lhz\`** (load
halfword zero), and a *signed* \`s16\` switches to **\`lha\`** (load halfword
algebraic = sign-extend). This is how you recover a global's type from
disassembly: the displacement says "it's a global," the opcode says "this wide,
this signedness." A byte global read with \`lbz\` was a \`u8\`, not an \`int\`.

Writes mirror this exactly — a \`u8\` store is \`stb rX, sym@sda21(r13)\` and a
16-bit store is \`sth rX, sym@sda21(r13)\` (there's no signed/unsigned distinction
on stores; only the width matters). That \`stb\`/\`sth\` is just the narrow-width
sibling of the \`stw\` from the previous lesson.

    brief: `
# Floats get their own small-data section

Floating-point globals live in the SDA too, but conceptually in a *second*
small-data area. The GameCube ABI reserves **two** small-data base registers:
\`r13\` for the read/write sections (\`.sdata\`/\`.sbss\`) and **\`r2\`** for the
read-only ones (\`.sdata2\`, where const data and float constants sit). Don't read
\`r2\` as "the immutable global" register, though: MWCC parks float globals in
\`.sdata2\` *by default*, so even a writable \`f32\` like \`gGravity\` here is reached
through \`r2\`, while a plain \`int\` global goes to \`.sdata\` and uses \`r13\`. The
base register tracks the *section the compiler chose*, not the C \`const\`-ness. A
float global is read with **\`lfs\`** (load floating single) straight into an FPR:

\`\`\`asm
lfs   f1, fg@sda21(r2)   # load global float fg into f1
blr
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
R_PPC_EMB_SDA21   fg
\`\`\`

The relocation is still spelled \`R_PPC_EMB_SDA21\` — that one reloc type covers
both small-data windows, and the linker resolves it against whichever base
(\`r13\` or \`r2\`) the symbol's section uses. So an \`lfs sym@sda21\` feeding an FPR
result tells you \`sym\` was a global \`f32\`. No address computation, no constant
pool — just one load.

    concepts: ["globals", "sda21", "literal-pool", "lfs", "constants"],
    brief: `
# Where does \`0.5f\` come from?

There's no "load immediate float" instruction, so a literal like \`0.5f\` can't be
encoded inline. MWCC parks it as an anonymous **pooled constant** in small data
and loads it with \`lfs\`, just like a named global — except the symbol is a
compiler-generated label such as \`@5\` rather than a name you wrote:

\`\`\`asm
lfs   f0, @5@sda21(r2)   # load the pooled constant 0.5f
fmuls f1, f0, f1         # x * 0.5f
blr
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
R_PPC_EMB_SDA21   @5
\`\`\`

That \`@5\` relocation against an \`R_PPC_EMB_SDA21\` entry is a **literal pool** load.
Identical machinery to a global float read — the only tell that it's a literal and
not a named global is the synthetic \`@N\` symbol. When you see an \`lfs\` of an \`@N\`
symbol feeding straight into an arithmetic op, the original C had a float
constant in the expression.

\`x\` to double, multiplies in double precision, and converts back: you get
\`lfd\`/\`fmul\`/\`frsp\` instead of the \`lfs\`/\`fmuls\` shown above, and the match
fails. Forgetting the suffix is one of the most common real-world causes of a
float mismatch.

    brief: `
# Two ways to materialize an address

Returning the *address* of a global (rather than its value) splits into two cases.

**A small-data scalar** has its address sitting one \`r13\`/\`r2\` offset away, so MWCC
just adds that offset into a register — encoded with the SDA21 relocation. At link
time it becomes a real \`addi r3, r13, g\`. Unlinked, the offset and base register
aren't filled in yet, so the disassembler prints the bare \`addi r3, r3, 0\`
(equivalently shown as \`li r3, 0\`) with the reloc attached — there's no
\`g@sda21(r13)\` text in the raw object; that operand only exists once the linker
resolves it:

\`\`\`asm
addi  r3, r13, g@sda21   # r3 = &g  (small-data scalar# "li r3, 0" + reloc unlinked)
blr
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
R_PPC_EMB_SDA21   g
\`\`\`

**A non-small-data symbol** — anything the linker places outside the SDA window,
such as an array — needs its full 32-bit address built from two halves with the
classic **high-adjusted / low** pair:

\`\`\`asm
lis   r3, tbl@ha        # r3 = high 16 bits (adjusted for sign of the low half)
addi  r3, r3, tbl@l     # add the low 16 bits → full &tbl
blr
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
R_PPC_ADDR16_HA   tbl
R_PPC_ADDR16_LO   tbl
\`\`\`

\`@ha\` is "high adjusted" (the top half, +1 if the low half is negative); \`@l\` is
the low half. That \`lis ...@ha\` / \`addi ...@l\` pair with \`R_PPC_ADDR16_HA\` +
\`R_PPC_ADDR16_LO\` is *the* signature of a non-SDA address. Arrays in particular
land here — which is exactly what this lesson exercises.

    brief: `
# Base address plus a scaled index

Reading \`tbl[i]\` from a global array combines the address-building you just saw
with a **scaled, indexed load**. The base comes from the \`@ha\`/\`@l\` pair (arrays
aren't small-data), the index \`i\` is multiplied by the element size, and a single
indexed load (\`lwzx\` — "load word zero, indexed") fetches the element:

\`\`\`asm
lis   r4, tbl@ha        # high half of &tbl
slwi  r0, r3, 2         # r0 = i * 4   (sizeof(int) == 4)

blr
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
R_PPC_ADDR16_HA   tbl
R_PPC_ADDR16_LO   tbl
\`\`\`

\`slwi r0, r3, 2\` is "shift left word immediate by 2" = multiply by 4, the
\`int\` element size. \`lwzx rD, rA, rB\` loads from \`rA + rB\` — base plus the scaled
offset, no displacement needed. The two \`R_PPC_ADDR16\` relocations confirm it's a
global array rather than a small-data scalar.

Notice the \`slwi\` lands *between* the \`lis\` and the \`addi\` even though it has
nothing to do with building the base address. That's instruction scheduling, not
meaning: the index scaling is independent of the address pair, so MWCC slots it
into the gap to hide the \`lis\` latency. Order like this is normal in real
CodeWarrior output — don't read it as significant.

into a byte global:
