# The other kind of switch

In the control chapter you met the **compare chain** — a cascade of \`cmpwi\` /
\`beq-\` / \`bge-\` that bisects a handful of cases. But when the cases are
**dense and numerous** (here \`0..7\`, all consecutive), MWCC stops comparing
one value at a time and builds a **computed jump**: it uses \`x\` itself as an
index into a table of code addresses.

\`\`\`asm
cmplwi r3, 7        ; bounds check: is x in 0..7?
bgt-   .default     ; above the table -> default arm
lis    r4, table@ha ; load the base address of the @switch table...
slwi   r0, r3, 2    ; x * 4  (each table entry is a 4-byte address)
addi   r3, r4, table@lo
lwzx   r0, r3, r0   ; load table[x]  -> the target address
mtctr  r0           ; move it into the count register
bctr                ; branch to CTR  -> jump straight to case x
\`\`\`

Three fingerprints give it away: the **single \`cmplwi\` bounds check** (note
\`cmplwi\`, unsigned — a negative \`x\` wraps to a huge value and fails the check
for free), the \`slwi r0, r3, 2\` index scaling, and the
\`lwzx\` → \`mtctr\` → \`bctr\` trio that loads an address from a \`@switch\` rodata
table and jumps through it. After \`bctr\`, each case is its own tiny
\`li r3, N\` / \`blr\` block. No per-case compares at all — the dispatch is O(1).

## Your task

Write \`dispatch\`: a \`switch\` on \`x\` with cases \`0..7\` returning
\`100, 211, 322, 433, 544, 655, 766, 877\` respectively, and \`-1\` by default.

    concepts: ["switch", "jump-table", "compare-chain", "heuristic"],
    brief: `
# When does MWCC pick which?

The table form and the compare chain are *both* in MWCC's toolbox, and the
choice is mechanical: it depends on how many cases there are and how densely
they pack. Two rules of thumb that this compiler follows:

- **Dense and few → compare chain.** A run of \`0..5\` (six consecutive cases)
  still bisects with \`cmpwi\` / \`beq-\` / \`bge-\`. The crossover on this
  toolchain is **seven** consecutive cases: \`0..6\` and up switch to the table.
- **Sparse → compare chain, always.** Cases like \`1, 10, 100, 500\` are far
  apart. A table indexed by \`x\` would need 500 entries (mostly default) — far
  too big — so MWCC bisects them no matter how many there are:

\`\`\`asm
cmpwi r3, 100      ; probe the middle case value
beq-  .case100
bge-  .hi          ; x > 100 -> search the upper half
cmpwi r3, 10
beq-  .case10
bge-  .default
cmpwi r3, 1
beq-  .case1
b     .default
\`\`\`

So when you're matching a switch, **count the cases and check their spread
first**. A lone \`cmplwi\` + \`bctr\` means dense-and-many (write consecutive
cases). A staircase of \`cmpwi\`/\`beq-\` against scattered constants means the
original values were sparse — and the *constants in the asm* tell you exactly
which case labels to write.

## Your task

Write \`route\`, a sparse \`switch\` on \`x\`: case \`1\` → \`11\`, case \`10\` → \`22\`,

# Why a float function stores 64 + 32 bits per register

The Gekko's floating-point registers \`f14\`–\`f31\` are **callee-saved**: a
function that keeps live float values across a call must preserve them and
restore them before returning. What's surprising is *how* MWCC saves each one —
not one store, but **two**:

\`\`\`asm
stwu   r1, -96(r1)
mflr   r0
stw    r0, 100(r1)
stfd   f31, 80(r1)        ; save the 64-bit double view of f31...
psq_st f31, 88(r1), 0, 0  ; ...AND the paired-single (two 32-bit) view
stfd   f30, 64(r1)
psq_st f30, 72(r1), 0, 0
...
\`\`\`

Each callee-saved FPR gets an \`stfd\` (store float double) **paired with a**
\`psq_st\` (*store paired-single quantized*). The Gekko can hold **two packed
32-bit floats** in one FPR, and \`stfd\` alone would only preserve the
double-precision lane — so MWCC emits the \`psq_st\` to guarantee both
paired-single halves survive too. The epilogue mirrors it exactly:
\`psq_l\` then \`lfd\` for each register, highest-numbered first.

When you see a prologue full of \`stfd\`/\`psq_st\` pairs climbing \`f31, f30,
f29...\`, that's just **callee-saved float registers** — the function is
float-heavy enough to spill them. You match it by writing C with enough live
\`f32\` values across calls; the saves fall out automatically.

## Your task

Write \`mix(f32 *p)\`: call the provided \`transform\` on \`p[0]..p[5]\` into locals

# The one place inline asm is allowed

The decomp project bans inline \`asm{}\` almost everywhere — clean C that
byte-matches is the whole point. There is **exactly one sanctioned
exception**: the **paired-single load/store** instructions \`psq_l\` and
\`psq_st\` (and the \`ps_*\` arithmetic family). The reason is blunt: **MWCC GC/2.0
has no intrinsic for them.** You cannot write C that emits a \`psq_l\` against an
arbitrary address the way you can coax a \`psq_st\` out of an FPR spill — so when
the original code deliberately packed two floats and moved them as a unit, the
only faithful recovery is a tiny \`asm{}\` block.

It compiles cleanly here as long as the pointer operands are
\`register\`-qualified (the assembler needs them already in a GPR):

\`\`\`asm
psq_l  f0, 0(r4), 0, 0   ; load two packed 32-bit floats from src into f0
psq_st f0, 0(r3), 0, 0   ; store both halves to dst

\`\`\`

Read the operand form \`psq_l fD, offset(rA), W, I\`: \`W\` selects 1-vs-2 values,
\`I\` picks a graphics-quantization mode (\`0\` = no scaling, plain \`f32\`). One last
trap: **stock objdump mis-decodes paired-singles as PowerPC VSX**. The project
ships a patched objdump and disassembles with **\`-M gekko\`** (cc.mjs already
does) — without it, \`psq_l\` shows up as garbage VSX mnemonics and you'll think
the match is broken when it isn't.

# An enum compiles to nothing special

Under this project's flags (\`-enum int\`, equivalently \`#pragma enum int\`),
every \`enum\` is exactly **int-sized — 4 bytes**. That has a liberating
consequence: an enum-typed field and an \`int\` field generate **identical**
code. Compare a struct field against an enum constant:

\`\`\`asm
lwz    r0, 0(r3)      ; load the 4-byte state field
subfic r0, r0, 2      ; r0 = 2 - state   (zero iff state == 2)
cntlzw r0, r0
srwi   r3, r0, 5      ; the "== " idiom -> 0/1

That \`lwz\` (a full word, not \`lbz\`/\`lhz\`) confirms the field is 4 bytes wide,
and the \`subfic\`/\`cntlzw\`/\`srwi\` is the plain equality idiom you already know.
Now here's the point: **this is byte-for-byte the same** whether you wrote
\`a->state == STATE_RUN\` with a real enum or \`a->state == 2\` with a bare \`int\`
and a magic number. The enum names contribute *zero* bytes.

So **recovering an enum is a naming decision, not a codegen one.** When the asm
compares a 4-byte field against small integer constants \`0, 1, 2, 3...\`, you're
free to introduce an \`enum\` and meaningful names — it won't change a single
instruction, it just makes the C readable and the intent obvious.

    brief: `
# When the optimizer is forbidden to remember

At \`-O4,p\` MWCC aggressively **CSEs** (common-subexpression eliminates) memory
reads: if you load the same global twice with nothing changing it in between,
it loads **once** and reuses the value. A plain global summed with itself:

\`\`\`asm
lwz r0, g_plain@sda21(r2)   ; ONE load...
add r3, r0, r0              ; ...reused for both operands
blr
\`\`\`

Mark that same global **\`volatile\`** and the rule inverts. \`volatile\` means
"every access is observable — never fold, never cache, never reorder." So two
reads in the source become **two real loads** in the asm:

\`\`\`asm
lwz r3, g_counter@sda21(r2) ; first read
lwz r0, g_counter@sda21(r2) ; SECOND read -- not CSE'd
add r3, r3, r0

\`\`\`

This is the single most reliable fingerprint of \`volatile\`: **a value loaded
more times than the source seems to need, with no store in between.** If your
match keeps the CSE'd single load but the target shows the redundant reload, the
original variable was \`volatile\` — and vice versa. It matters far beyond
counting loads: \`volatile\` also blocks the reordering \`,p\` scheduling would
otherwise do, which is exactly what hardware-register code depends on.

# Reading a memory-mapped register

The GameCube exposes hardware through **memory-mapped registers** — fixed
addresses like \`0xCC003000\` where each read returns live device state. The
idiomatic access is a cast through a \`volatile\` pointer: \`*(vu32*)0xCC003000\`
(\`vu32\` is \`volatile u32\`). The \`volatile\` is load-bearing in the most literal
sense — without it, reading the register twice would CSE to one load and you'd
miss whatever changed between reads.

Two reads of the same hardware register therefore stay two reads:

\`\`\`asm
lis r3, 0xCC00      ; build the high half of the address (shown as -13312)
lwz r0, 0x3000(r3)  ; first read of the register
lwz r3, 0x3000(r3)  ; SECOND read -- volatile keeps it
add r3, r0, r3
blr
\`\`\`

Note \`lis\` materializes the upper 16 bits of \`0xCC003000\` and the \`lwz\`
displacement carries the lower \`0x3000\`. (objdump prints the \`lis\` immediate as
the signed \`-13312\`, which is \`0xCC00\`.) Every access reloads. This repeated
load-from-a-fixed-address pattern, with no store between the loads, is the
signature of polling a hardware register — and recovering it means typing the
pointer \`volatile\`, not bolting on a workaround.

Real engine code rarely shows one idiom at a time. A frame's state-machine step
might check a \`volatile\` abort flag, then dispatch on an \`enum\` state through a
\`switch\`. Each piece you've learned is visible in the asm — stacked:

\`\`\`asm
lwz    r0, g_abort@sda21(r2) ; volatile read of the abort flag...
