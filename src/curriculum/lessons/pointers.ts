# Reading from memory

A pointer is just an address sitting in a register. To read the value it points
at, PowerPC uses a **load**: \`lwz rD, off(rA)\` — *load word and zero* — fetches
the 32-bit word at \`rA + off\` into \`rD\`.

With the pointer arriving in \`r3\` and an offset of zero, \`*p\` is a single load:

\`\`\`asm
lwz  r3, 0(r3)    # r3 = *p
blr
\`\`\`

The \`0(r3)\` is the **base + displacement** addressing mode you'll see
everywhere: a register holding an address, plus a constant byte offset. Here the
displacement is \`0\` because we want the very first word.

# Writing to memory

The mirror image of a load is a **store**. \`stw rS, off(rA)\` — *store word* —
writes the 32-bit value in \`rS\` to the address \`rA + off\`. Note the operand
order: the *source register comes first*, the address second — the reverse of
how you read \`*p = v\` in C.

With the pointer in \`r3\` and the value in \`r4\`:

\`\`\`asm
stw  r4, 0(r3)    # *p = v

A store produces no result, so the function just returns. The same
base + displacement addressing mode from the load applies here too.

# The displacement field earns its keep

When you index a pointer with a *constant*, like \`p[2]\`, the compiler folds the
offset straight into the displacement field of the load. There's no separate
add. Since each \`int\` is 4 bytes, element 2 lives at byte offset \`2 * 4 = 8\`:

\`\`\`asm
lwz  r3, 8(r3)    # r3 = p[2]

This is the first place **element size** shows up: the C index \`2\` becomes the
byte displacement \`8\`. Reading disassembly, you divide back — a displacement of
\`8\` on an \`int*\` means index \`2\`.

Storing at a constant index works exactly like the load did — the index scales
into a displacement, and a \`stw\` writes there. With \`p\` in \`r3\` and \`v\` in

Whenever you see a store (or load) with a non-zero constant displacement that's

# \`p + 3\` is not \`+ 3\`

Adding to a pointer doesn't add a raw number — it advances by **whole
elements**. For an \`int*\`, \`p + 3\` moves forward \`3 * 4 = 12\` bytes. With a
*constant* offset MWCC folds the scaled distance into an \`addi\`:

\`\`\`asm
addi r3, r3, 12   # p + 3, scaled by sizeof(int)
blr
\`\`\`

The result is the new address, returned in \`r3\`. This is why \`p + 3\` and
\`&p[3]\` are the same thing: both produce the address \`p + 12 bytes\`. The element
size silently multiplies every pointer offset you write. The decompilation
implication: since both forms emit identical assembly, you *can't* tell from the
output which one the author wrote — pick whichever reads more naturally in
context (\`&arr[i]\` for array-shaped data, \`p + n\` for pointer walks).

    brief: `
# When the index is a register

A *constant* index folded into a displacement. A *variable* index can't — it
isn't known at compile time. The compiler must scale it at runtime, then use the
**indexed** load \`lwzx rD, rA, rB\`, which reads from \`rA + rB\` (two registers,
no displacement).

For an \`int*\`, the index is scaled by 4 with a shift-left-by-2 (\`slwi\`):

\`\`\`asm
slwi r0, r4, 2    # i * 4  (sizeof(int))
lwzx r3, r3, r0   # load p[i]
blr
\`\`\`

So \`slwi\` by 2 followed by \`lwzx\` is the signature of an \`int*\` indexed by a
variable. The shift amount tells you the element size: 2 → 4-byte elements.

One thing to recognize in the wild: \`slwi rA, rB, n\` is itself a simplified
mnemonic for \`rlwinm rA, rB, n, 0, 31-n\`. Disassemblers like objdump or Ghidra
often print the underlying \`rlwinm\` (here \`rlwinm r0, r4, 2, 0, 29\`) instead of
the friendlier \`slwi r0, r4, 2\` — they're the same shift.

char u8;\` — and shows up everywhere in this codebase. The matching signed and
wider types are \`s8\`, \`u16\`/\`s16\`, \`u32\`/\`s32\`.)

The scaling factor *is* the element size. A \`u8\` is one byte, so scaling \`i\` by
1 is a no-op — there's no shift at all. The index register goes straight into
the indexed byte load \`lbzx rD, rA, rB\` (*load byte and zero*, indexed):

\`\`\`asm
lbzx r3, r3, r4   # r3 = p[i], zero-extended

\`lbzx\` zero-extends the byte into the full register, which is exactly what an
unsigned \`u8\` wants. When you only load and store a byte, \`u8\` is the natural
choice; using \`char\` would bring in a sign-extending \`extsb\` the compiler
wouldn't otherwise need. That gives you a diagnostic rule when reading
disassembly: \`lbzx\` (or \`lbz\`) *alone* with no following \`extsb\` is strong
evidence the original type was unsigned; \`lbzx\` followed by \`extsb\` points to a

signed \`s16\` sign-extends with \`lhax\` (*load halfword algebraic*, indexed).

# Advancing a pointer in a loop

A classic string walk reads bytes until it hits the NUL terminator, counting as
it goes. The compiler keeps the running pointer in \`r3\` and the count in \`r4\`,
bumping both with \`addi\` and re-checking the loaded byte against zero each
iteration:

\`\`\`asm

# Equality without a branch

Two pointers are equal when their addresses are equal, so \`a == b\` is really an
integer equality. Returning that comparison as a \`BOOL\` (in the GameCube SDK
headers \`BOOL\` is just a typedef for \`int\`, with \`TRUE == 1\` and \`FALSE == 0\`,
so it carries no special compiler semantics) without branching, MWCC reaches for
a clever trick: subtract, then count leading zeros.

\`\`\`asm

Swapping the values behind two pointers is pure memory traffic: load both, then

it appears as the *base* register of a load/store (\`0(r0)\`, say) the hardware
