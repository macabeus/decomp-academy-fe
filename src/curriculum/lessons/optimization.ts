    brief: `
# The compiler that fights you back

Every lesson on this site is compiled at **\`-O4,p\`** — the most aggressive
setting MWCC GC/2.0 has. The \`4\` is the optimization *level* (full
inlining, common-subexpression elimination, strength reduction, loop work). The
\`,p\` means **optimize for the pipeline** — schedule instructions for the
Gekko's execution units rather than just for size. (The \`,p\` is an MWCC-specific
sub-flag; if you know GCC's \`-O\` levels, this comma syntax has no GCC
equivalent.)

This changes the whole game. At \`-O0\` the assembly mirrors your C line by line.
At \`-O4,p\` the compiler is allowed to **reorder**, **fuse**, **delete**, and
**rematerialize** instructions as long as the observable result is identical.
Two things follow:

- The instruction *order* in the binary often does **not** match the source
  order. The optimizer hoists independent work to hide latency.
- To byte-match, you don't fight the optimizer — you feed it C whose
  *optimized* form equals the target. That is the entire craft of this chapter.

Here are two independent loads-and-adds, then a multiply of the results:

\`\`\`asm
lwz   r6, 0(r3)    # all four loads hoisted to the top...
lwz   r5, 4(r3)
lwz   r4, 8(r3)
lwz   r0, 12(r3)
add   r3, r6, r5   # ...then the two adds...
add   r0, r4, r0
mullw r3, r3, r0   # ...then the dependent multiply
blr
\`\`\`

Notice the four \`lwz\` are batched at the front even though the source computed
\`a\` fully before touching \`b\`. That batching is \`,p\` scheduling at work — we
dissect it next lesson.

    concepts: ["scheduling", "latency", "pipelining"],
    brief: `
# Why the order looks scrambled

A load from memory takes several cycles before its result is usable. If the very
next instruction needs that value, the pipeline **stalls**. The \`,p\` scheduler
avoids this by moving *independent* instructions into the gap — the CPU does
useful work while the load is in flight.

Consider two completely independent sums that are then multiplied. With
scheduling **off**, MWCC emits them in source order — compute \`a\`, then \`b\`:

\`\`\`asm
lwz   r4, 0(r3)
lwz   r0, 4(r3)
add   r5, r4, r0   # a = p[0]+p[1]
lwz   r4, 8(r3)
lwz   r0, 12(r3)
add   r0, r4, r0   # b = p[2]+p[3]
mullw r3, r5, r0
\`\`\`

With scheduling **on** (the default at \`-O4,p\`), all four loads are issued
first so their latencies overlap, *then* the adds run back to back:

\`\`\`asm
lwz   r6, 0(r3)
lwz   r5, 4(r3)
lwz   r4, 8(r3)    # loads batched — latencies overlap
lwz   r0, 12(r3)
add   r3, r6, r5
add   r0, r4, r0
mullw r3, r3, r0
\`\`\`

Same instructions, **different order and register coloring**. The coloring
isn't random: MWCC assigns registers *after* it has reordered, so a different
schedule yields a different live-range layout and therefore different register
numbers. When a target's order looks "interleaved" like this, it's the
scheduler — not a clue about the source. Your C stays simple; the scheduler
produces the shape.

    concepts: ["peephole", "dot-form", "condition-register"],
    brief: `
# A compare that disappears into the instruction before it

After scheduling, a separate **peephole** pass scans short windows of
instructions and rewrites them. Its signature trick on PowerPC is **dot-form
merging**.

Most arithmetic/logical instructions have a *recording* variant whose mnemonic
ends in \`.\` (e.g. \`add.\`, \`and.\`, \`rlwinm.\`). The recording form sets condition
register field \`cr0\` as a side effect — exactly as if you had compared the
result against zero. So when you mask a value and then test it against zero, the
peephole optimizer folds the \`cmpwi ...,0\` **into** the masking instruction by
flipping it to its dot form:

\`\`\`asm
clrlwi. r0, r3, 24   # r0 = x & 0xFF, AND set cr0 from the result
beq-    L            # branch on that cr0 — no separate compare!
add     r5, r4, r0
\`\`\`

The \`.\` on \`clrlwi.\` is the whole story: the comparison against zero was
absorbed. One instruction now does the mask *and* the test. Recognizing a
trailing \`.\` as "this result also feeds a branch/select" is essential reading
skill — and reproducing it means writing C where the masked value is reused.

## Your task

Write \`pick(int x, int a, int b)\`: let \`y = x & 0xFF\`; return \`a + y\` when \`y\`
is non-zero, otherwise \`b\`. The optimizer will merge the mask and the test into
a single \`clrlwi.\`.

    brief: `
# When the target *kept* its separate compare

Sometimes the retail object was compiled with the peephole pass disabled for a
region, so the dot-merge from the last lesson **never happened**. You will see
a plain (non-dot) instruction followed by an explicit \`cmpwi ...,0\`. No C
rewrite reproduces that — the only lever is the same pragma the original author
used:

\`\`\`c
#pragma peephole off
/* ...function... */
#pragma peephole reset
\`\`\`

With the pragma in force, the very same body that merged before now keeps the
compare split out:

\`\`\`asm
clrlwi  r0, r3, 24    # mask — NOT the dot form
cmpwi   r0, 0         # explicit compare the peephole would have absorbed
beq-    L
add     r3, r4, r0
\`\`\`

Side by side, the only difference is the dot-merge:

\`\`\`asm
# peephole ON (lesson 3)   # peephole OFF (this lesson)
clrlwi. r0, r3, 24         clrlwi  r0, r3, 24
                           cmpwi   r0, 0
beq-    L                  beq-    L

The \`.\` is gone and a whole \`cmpwi\` reappears. This is the canonical
\`peephole off\` signature. In real decomp you bracket a function (or a run of
them) and pair every \`off\` with a \`reset\`.

    brief: `
# Putting the instructions back in source order

The other half of the SFA pragma pair is **\`scheduling off\`**. It tells MWCC to
emit instructions in (essentially) source order instead of reordering them to
hide latency. When a target was built this way, the scheduled "loads-first"
shape you saw earlier **does not appear** — the loads sit right next to the work
that consumes them.

Same two-sums-times body as lesson 1, but with scheduling disabled:

\`\`\`asm
lwz   r4, 0(r3)
lwz   r0, 4(r3)
add   r5, r4, r0    # a computed immediately after its loads
lwz   r4, 8(r3)
lwz   r0, 12(r3)
add   r0, r4, r0    # b computed immediately after its loads
mullw r3, r5, r0
\`\`\`

The four loads are *not* batched; each pair sits with its \`add\`. That ordering —
and the different register coloring it produces — is the fingerprint of
\`scheduling off\`. As with peephole, you bracket the region and always pair
\`off\` with \`reset\`. The two pragmas are frequently used together around a whole
function in real decomp.

    brief: `
# FP latencies are long — so the scheduler tries hardest here

Floating-point loads and \`fmuls\` have multi-cycle latencies, so the \`,p\`
scheduler is most visibly active on FP code. Take a two-element dot product
\`a[0]*b[0] + a[1]*b[1]\`. Written the obvious way it would load a[0],b[0], multiply,
load a[1],b[1], multiply-add. The scheduler instead hoists a later load and
starts the second product *early*, weaving the two computations together:

\`\`\`asm
lfs    f1, 4(r3)     # a[1] loaded first
lfs    f0, 4(r4)     # b[1]
lfs    f2, 0(r3)     # a[0] slotted in behind
fmuls  f0, f1, f0    # a[1]*b[1] started before a[0]*b[0]
lfs    f1, 0(r4)     # b[0]
fmadds f1, f2, f1, f0
blr
\`\`\`

The loads and the two FP ops are **interleaved**, not grouped per term. This is
the same scheduler from lesson 2, but the payoff is larger because FP stalls are
longer.

Note that the \`fmadds\` here comes from \`fp_contract\` fusion, *not* from the
scheduler — they're two independent mechanisms that happen to both be on at
\`-O4,p\`. The next lesson covers \`fp_contract\` in detail; for now just notice it
exists so you don't attribute the fused multiply-add to scheduling.

When an FP target's loads look shuffled across the multiplies, suspect the
scheduler before you suspect an exotic source expression.

# One instruction or two?

The Gekko has a **fused multiply-add**: \`fmadds f1, fA, fC, fB\` computes
\`fA*fC + fB\` in a single instruction (and a single rounding step). When
**\`fp_contract\`** is **on** — our default — MWCC contracts an \`a*b + c\` pattern
into exactly that:

\`\`\`asm
fmadds f1, f1, f2, f3   # a*b + c, fused

Turn \`fp_contract\` **off** and the compiler is forbidden from fusing; you get
the multiply and the add as **two** instructions with two roundings:

fmuls f0, f1, f2        # a*b
fadds f1, f3, f0        # + c

    brief: `
# A multiply per iteration becomes one add per iteration

Inside a loop, \`i * K\` where \`i\` is the loop counter is a textbook target for
**strength reduction**. Instead of recomputing \`mulli ..., K\` every iteration,
the optimizer keeps a running value that starts at zero and increases by \`K\`
each pass — turning a multiply into a single add. (At \`-O4,p\` MWCC also unrolls
the hot path eight-wide, so the full function is large; the *idea* lives in the
remainder loop at the end.)

Don't be alarmed when your output runs to dozens of instructions: MWCC emits a
prologue that picks the eight-wide path when \`n\` is large, an unrolled body that
stores eight elements per pass under a \`bdnz\`, and then the short tail loop below
that handles the leftover \`0..7\` elements one at a time. It's the tail loop where
the strength-reduced \`+= 12\` is cleanest, so that's what we show.

For \`dst[i] = i * 12\`, the tail loop shows the reduced form clearly:

\`\`\`asm
L:
  stw   r6, 0(r3)     # store the running product
  addi  r6, r6, 12    # product += 12  (was i*12, now just +12)
  addi  r3, r3, 4     # dst pointer also strength-reduced (+= 4)
  bdnz+ L

There is no \`mulli\` in that loop body at all — both the value \`i*12\` and the
address \`&dst[i]\` became cheap induction variables incremented by a constant.
When you see a loop bumping a register by a fixed stride with no multiply in
sight, that's strength reduction, and the original C almost certainly used a
multiply or array index that *looked* expensive.

# Compute it once, use it twice

When the same expression appears more than once and nothing in between can change
its value, \`-O4\` computes it **once** and reuses the result. This is
**common-subexpression elimination (CSE)**. It's why a target may contain *fewer*
arithmetic instructions than your source literally spelled out.

Write \`a / b\` twice in one expression and a simpler compiler would emit two
\`divw\`s (division is expensive). MWCC emits exactly one:

\`\`\`asm
divw  r3, r3, r4    # q = a / b   — computed ONCE
mulli r0, r3, 7     # q * 7
add   r3, r3, r0    # q + q*7

\`\`\`

The second \`a / b\` reused \`r3\`; there is no second \`divw\`. When a target has one
copy of an expensive op but your C "uses it twice," don't add a temporary to
force two — write it naturally and trust CSE to collapse the duplicate, exactly
as the original author relied on it to.

One precondition, though: CSE only fires when nothing between the two uses can
change the value. An intervening store, a \`volatile\`, or a write through a
possibly-aliasing pointer all block it, and you'll see the expensive op appear
twice. So a single \`divw\` standing in for two source uses tells you the region
was side-effect-free between them — don't over-generalize the pattern to loops
or pointer writes where the compiler can't prove that.

Time to combine the chapter. A linear interpolation \`a + (b - a) * t\` is the
beating heart of game code (it's literally what SFA's lighting lerps do). Do two
of them and add the results, and three optimizations fire together:

- **fp_contract** fuses each \`a + (b - a) * t\` so the final \`*t + a\` becomes one
  \`fmadds\` (after the \`fsubs\` for \`b - a\`).
- **scheduling** hoists all four \`lfs\` loads to the front and **interleaves** the
  two lerps so their latencies overlap.
- the whole thing stays branch-free and tightly register-allocated thanks to
  \`-O4\`.

At our default \`-O4,p\` with \`fp_contract on\`, the two lerps come out woven
together:

Had this unit used \`#pragma scheduling off\`, the two lerps would appear as two
*separate* sequential blocks (load–load–fsubs–fmadds, then again) instead of the
interleaved form above — the exact distinction this chapter trains you to spot.

## Your task

Write \`blend(f32 *a, f32 *b, f32 t)\` returning
\`(a[0] + (b[0]-a[0])*t) + (a[1] + (b[1]-a[1])*t)\`. Write the two lerps plainly
and let the optimizer fuse and interleave.
