# Multiply low

PowerPC multiplies two registers with **\`mullw rD, rA, rB\`** ("multiply low
word"), keeping the low 32 bits of the product:

\`\`\`asm
mullw r3, r3, r4
blr
\`\`\`

There's no immediate form of \`mullw\`; multiplying by a *variable* always lands
here. Multiplying by a *constant* is a different story — that's the next lesson.

# Strength reduction

Compilers replace expensive operations with cheap equivalent ones — **strength
reduction**. Multiplying by a power of two becomes a left shift, which on
PowerPC is the \`rlwinm\` rotate instruction (MWCC prints it via the \`slwi\`
extended mnemonic):

\`\`\`asm
slwi r3, r3, 3    # x << 3  == x * 8
blr
\`\`\`

If you wrote \`x * 8\` *or* \`x << 3\` you'd get the same instruction — they're
identical to the compiler. Recognizing that \`* 8\` is "really" a shift is a core
decompiler instinct.

A multiply by a non-power-of-two constant uses the **immediate** multiply
\`mulli rD, rA, imm\`:

(For some constants MWCC will instead synthesize the product from shifts and
adds when that's cheaper — but for many small values it just emits \`mulli\`.)

# Dividing unsigned is just a shift

For an **unsigned** value, dividing by a power of two is a logical right shift —
\`srwi\`, again an extended form of \`rlwinm\`:

\`\`\`asm
srwi r3, r3, 2    # x >> 2 == x / 4 (unsigned)
blr
\`\`\`

No rounding correction is needed because unsigned division truncates toward zero
and the high bits are simply discarded. **Signed** division by a power of two is
much trickier — it has to round toward zero for negatives, so MWCC emits a
\`srawi\`/\`addze\` correction pair rather than a plain shift, which the next lesson
walks through.

# Signed division rounds, so it needs a fixup

The unsigned case was a clean \`srwi\`. Signed division by a power of two is
trickier: C rounds *toward zero*, but an arithmetic shift rounds *toward
negative infinity*. For a negative dividend those differ — \`-1 / 4\` is \`0\` in C,
yet \`-1 >> 2\` is \`-1\` — so MWCC adds a correction:

\`\`\`asm
srawi r0, r3, 2    # x >> 2, biased the wrong way for negatives
addze r3, r0       # add the carry back: +1 only when x was negative
blr
\`\`\`

\`srawi\` sets the carry bit when it shifts a 1 out of a negative value; \`addze\`
("add to zero, extended with carry") then nudges the quotient back toward zero
exactly when needed. A positive dividend produces no carry, so \`addze\` adds
nothing. This **\`srawi\` + \`addze\`** pair is the unmistakable signature of a
signed divide by a power of two — distinct from the lone \`srwi\` of the unsigned
case.

# When it really is a divide

Dividing by a *variable* can't be reduced to shifts, so the compiler emits the
hardware **\`divw rD, rA, rB\`** (signed divide word):

\`\`\`asm
divw r3, r3, r4

Unsigned division by a variable uses \`divwu\` instead. The signed/unsigned choice
is driven entirely by the C types — another reminder that *types decide the
instruction*.

# Remainder = divide, multiply back, subtract

PowerPC has no remainder instruction. \`a % b\` is computed as
\`a - (a / b) * b\`, so you'll see a divide, a multiply, and a subtract working
together:

\`\`\`asm
divw  r0, r3, r4   # q = a / b
mullw r0, r0, r4   # q * b
subf  r3, r0, r3   # a - q*b
blr
\`\`\`

Watch the operand order on \`subf\`: \`subf rD, rA, rB\` computes \`rD = rB - rA\`,
the *reverse* of how the mnemonic reads. Here \`subf r3, r0, r3\` is \`r3 - r0\`,
i.e. \`a - q*b\`. That backwards subtraction is a classic PowerPC gotcha.

Spotting this divide → \`mullw\` → \`subf\` trio in the wild instantly tells you the
original C was a \`%\` operator.

# Chaining adds (and a scheduling surprise)

\`a + b + c\` needs two \`add\`s — but watch *which* registers MWCC picks. At
\`-O4,p\` it doesn't naïvely accumulate into \`r3\`; it stashes \`a\` in a scratch
register, sums \`b + c\` first, then folds \`a\` back in:

\`\`\`asm
mr   r0, r3        # save a into scratch r0
add  r3, r4, r5    # b + c first
add  r3, r0, r3    # + a
blr
\`\`\`

\`r0\` is a volatile scratch register MWCC grabs freely inside a function. (It has
one architectural quirk for later: when used as a base in a load/store address,
\`r0\` reads as the literal value 0 instead of its contents — so it can't be an
addressing base.)

The result is identical, but the instruction order is the optimizer's, not the
source's. Predicting these small reorderings is exactly what matching trains.
