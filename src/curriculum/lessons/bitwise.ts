# Keeping only the bits you want

A bitwise **AND** against a constant *mask* keeps the bits that are set in the
mask and clears the rest. When the mask has scattered (non-contiguous) bits,
MWCC reaches for the immediate-AND instruction **\`andi.\`**:

\`\`\`asm
andi.  r3, r3, 18    # r3 = x & 0x12
blr
\`\`\`

Two things to notice. First, \`andi.\` takes a 16-bit immediate, so it can only
mask the low half-word directly. Second, the trailing **dot** means it also
updates condition register \`cr0\` as a side effect — MWCC uses \`andi.\` even when
nobody reads the flags, simply because it's the only immediate AND PowerPC has.

(Watch out: a *contiguous* mask like \`0xF0\` takes a different path — covered in
"Testing Whether a Bit Is Set". For now we use \`0x12\`, whose bits don't form a
run.)

# Forcing bits on

A bitwise **OR** turns bits *on*: every bit set in the mask becomes set in the
result, and the others pass through untouched. MWCC emits the immediate form
**\`ori\`**:

\`\`\`asm
ori  r3, r3, 18    # r3 = x | 0x12
blr
\`\`\`

Unlike \`andi.\`, plain \`ori\` has **no dot** and never touches the condition
register. Notice OR doesn't care whether the mask bits are contiguous: \`ori\`
handles any 16-bit pattern, so you won't see the rotate tricks that AND
sometimes triggers.

One limit to keep in mind: \`ori\` only carries a 16-bit immediate. A constant
wider than 16 bits (say \`x | 0x12345\`) splits into two instructions — \`oris\`
for the high half-word, then \`ori\` for the low — so don't be surprised to see a
pair when the mask outgrows the bottom 16 bits.

# Toggling bits

A bitwise **XOR** *flips* every bit that is set in the mask: a 1 in the mask

XOR is the bit-twiddler's toggle switch: applying the same mask twice returns
the original value. Like \`ori\`, \`xori\` carries no dot and leaves the condition

# The \`|=\` idiom for flags

Game code is full of flag words where each bit means something — *visible*,
*active*, *dirty*. To **set** one flag you OR in a single-bit mask, usually

\`\`\`asm
ori  r3, r3, 64    # x |= 0x40

Because \`0x40\` is a single bit inside the low 16, this collapses to one \`ori\`.
The whole point of \`|=\` is that it preserves every *other* flag — only the named
bit changes. Seeing a lone \`ori\` with a power-of-two immediate is a strong tell
that the original C was \`flags |= SOME_FLAG;\`.

    difficulty: 2,
    concepts: ["bitwise", "and", "rlwinm", "mwcc-idiom"],
    brief: `
# Why clearing a bit is *not* an \`andi.\`

To **clear** a single flag you AND with the *inverse* mask. The natural C is
\`x &= ~0x80\`. You might expect an \`andi.\` like the earlier AND lesson — but watch
what actually comes out:

\`\`\`asm
rlwinm  r3, r3, 0, 25, 23    # x & ~0x80
blr
\`\`\`

That's **\`rlwinm\`** (rotate-left-word-immediate-then-AND-with-mask), *not*
\`andi.\`. The reason is decisive: \`~0x80\` is \`0xFFFFFF7F\`, a 32-bit constant.
\`andi.\` only has a **16-bit** immediate and could never express the high bits, so
MWCC uses \`rlwinm\` with a rotate of 0 and a mask that spans everything except the
one bit being cleared. To derive that mask yourself: \`~0x80\` is \`0xFFFFFF7F\`, so
the only cleared bit is the one in \`0x80\`. PowerPC numbers bits from the MSB
(bit 0 = \`0x80000000\`, bit 31 = \`0x1\`), which puts \`0x80\` at **bit 24**. The mask
\`[MB,ME] = [25,23]\` therefore *wraps around* the word, covering bits 25-31 and
0-23 — everything except bit 24.

**This is a key MWCC idiom.** Write \`x &= ~0x80\` and you get \`rlwinm\`. If you had
instead written \`x &= 0xFF7F\`, you'd get an \`andi.\` — but note that isn't a
stylistic alternative: \`0xFF7F\` is \`0x0000FF7F\`, which also zeroes every bit above
bit 15, unlike \`~0x80\` (\`0xFFFFFF7F\`). So it's both the wrong instruction *and* the
wrong result — the source you write decides the instruction.

# Isolating one bit

To **test** a flag you AND the value with that single bit and return the result
(zero if clear, the bit's value if set). The mask \`0x80\` is a single contiguous
bit, and MWCC isolates it with a single **\`rlwinm\`**:

\`\`\`asm
rlwinm  r3, r3, 0, 24, 24    # x & 0x80
blr
\`\`\`

Here the rotate is again 0 and the mask is exactly **one** bit wide: \`[24,24]\`
selects bit 24, which is \`0x80\`. (PPC counts bits from the MSB: bit 0 is
\`0x80000000\`, bit 24 is \`0x80\`, bit 31 is \`0x1\` — so the value \`0x80\` lands at
bit number 24.) This is the mirror image of the AND-mask lesson — a *contiguous*
mask (even a one-bit one) goes through \`rlwinm\`, while a *scattered* mask like
\`0x12\` went through \`andi.\`. Contiguity, not size, is what steers AND between the
two instructions.

# \`slwi\` — shift left, fill with zeros

Shifting left by a constant moves bits toward the high end and pads the low end

\`\`\`asm

\`slwi\` mnemonic as "left shift by a constant" is enough. (As a mental check,
\`x << n\` equals \`x * 2^n\` arithmetically — but always write the shift in your

Right-shifting an **unsigned** value is a *logical* shift: bits move toward the

The **type drives this**. Because \`x\` is \`u32\`, the compiler knows the top bits

really \`rlwinm r3, r3, 29, 3, 31\`. If \`x\` were signed, the high bits would

# \`srawi\` — shift right, fill with the sign

Right-shifting a **signed** value is an *arithmetic* shift: the vacated high bits

\`srwi\` for \`u32\`, \`srawi\` for \`s32\`. (When the shift *amount* is a variable

# Shift *and* mask, fused into a single instruction

Extracting a packed field means shifting it down to bit 0 and masking off the
neighbours: \`(x >> 4) & 0xF\` pulls out the 4-bit nibble sitting at bits 4-7. In C
that reads like two operations, but \`rlwinm\` does **rotate and mask together**, so

Read the operands: rotate left by **28** (which is the same as rotating *right* by
4, moving bits 4-7 down to bits 0-3). Concretely, \`0x000000F0\` rotated left by 28
