# Welcome to decompilation

**Decompiling** is the art of recovering the original C source from a compiled
binary. Here you don't guess — you *prove* it. You write C, the real
**Metrowerks CodeWarrior GC/2.0** compiler turns it into PowerPC assembly, and
we compare it, instruction for instruction, against the target. When every
instruction lines up, you have a **100% match**. Even a single extra
instruction counts as a mismatch, so small choices like a variable's type
matter more than you might expect.

## The first piece of PowerPC to know

The GameCube's CPU returns a function's result in register **\`r3\`**. A function
that returns an integer constant therefore does just two things:

\`\`\`asm
li   r3, 42      # load immediate 42 into r3
blr              # branch to link register = "return"
\`\`\`

\`li\` means *load immediate* and \`blr\` (*branch to link register*) is how every
function returns. You'll see \`blr\` at the end of almost everything.

## Your task

The target on the right is exactly those two instructions. Write the C function
\`answer\` that returns **42**. Hit **Compile & Check** (or ⌘/Ctrl + Enter).
`,
    symbol: "answer",
    starter: `int answer(void) {
    // return the right number
    return 0;
}
`,
    solution: `int answer(void) {
    return 42;
}
`,
    hints: [
      "The function should return the literal value 42.",
      "A one-line `return` of that value is all it takes — the `li`/`blr` is the compiler's job.",
    ],

    concepts: ["registers", "calling-convention"],
    brief: `
# Where do arguments come from?

The GC ABI passes the first integer argument in **\`r3\`** — the *same* register
used for the return value. So a function that just returns its argument has
nothing to do: the value is already sitting in \`r3\`.

\`\`\`asm
blr              # r3 already holds x — just return
\`\`\`

That single \`blr\` is a perfect, if anticlimactic, match. Later integer and
pointer arguments go in \`r4\`, \`r5\`, \`r6\` … up to \`r10\`. Floating-point
arguments are separate: they use \`f1\`–\`f8\` and don't consume an integer
register slot.

## Your task

Write \`identity\`, which takes an \`int x\` and returns it unchanged.

    brief: `
# Reading a three-operand instruction

PowerPC arithmetic is **three-operand**: \`add rD, rA, rB\` computes
\`rD = rA + rB\`. With the first two arguments in \`r3\` and \`r4\`, and the result
expected in \`r3\`:

\`\`\`asm
add  r3, r3, r4
blr
\`\`\`

The destination comes **first**, then the two sources. Keep that order in mind —
it's an easy one to mix up at first. As in the identity lesson, the arguments
arrive left-to-right: \`a\` in \`r3\` and \`b\` in \`r4\`.

## Your task

Write \`add2\`, returning the sum of two \`int\`s.

# The quirk of \`subf\`

PowerPC has no plain \`sub\`. To compute \`a - b\` it uses **\`subf\`** — *subtract
from* — which computes \`rD = rB - rA\`. The operands are **reversed**:

\`\`\`asm
subf r3, r4, r3   # r3 = r3 - r4  =  a - b
blr
\`\`\`

So \`subf r3, r4, r3\` subtracts \`r4\` from \`r3\`, leaving \`a - b\` in \`r3\`. Once you
internalize that \`subf rD, rA, rB\` computes \`rB - rA\`, the disassembly stops
looking backwards.

## Your task

# Folding a constant into the instruction

When you add a small constant, the compiler doesn't load it into a register
first — it uses the **immediate** form \`addi rD, rA, imm\`:

\`\`\`asm
addi r3, r3, 1    # r3 = r3 + 1
blr
\`\`\`

Immediates are signed 16-bit, so the same \`addi\` handles subtraction of a
constant too (\`x - 5\` → \`addi r3, r3, -5\`). No separate instruction needed.
That 16-bit field only spans **-32768 to 32767**; constants outside that range
take two instructions (\`lis\` + \`addi\`). You won't see that here, but spotting the
pattern later will save you some confusion.

    brief: `
# One instruction, no zero needed

To negate a value PowerPC has a dedicated **\`neg rD, rA\`** (\`rD = -rA\`). It does
*not* subtract from a zero register the way some architectures would:

\`\`\`asm
neg  r3, r3
blr
\`\`\`

This is your first taste of a recurring theme: MWCC almost always reaches for the
**single dedicated instruction** when one exists, rather than composing the
operation from smaller pieces. Recognizing those idioms is most of the game.
