# A whole separate set of registers

Integers ride in \`r3\`, \`r4\`, … — but floating-point values get their own bank,
\`f1\` through \`f13\`. The first \`float\` argument arrives in **\`f1\`**, the second in
**\`f2\`**, and the result comes back in **\`f1\`** (the way \`r3\` works for ints).
Further float arguments continue in \`f3\`, \`f4\`, … just as integer arguments march
up \`r5\`, \`r6\` — so a three-\`float\` function takes its third argument in \`f3\`.

A \`float\` is **single-precision** (32-bit), and PowerPC has single-precision
arithmetic that ends in **\`s\`**. Addition is \`fadds\`:

\`\`\`asm
fadds f1, f1, f2   # f1 = a + b, single precision
blr

Same three-operand shape as \`add\`: destination first, then the two sources.

# A float divide that isn't a divide

\`fdivs\` only shows up when the divisor is a *runtime* value. Divide by a
**constant** and MWCC strength-reduces it the float way: it folds in the
reciprocal and emits a single \`fmuls\`. So \`x / 4.0f\` compiles as \`x * 0.25f\`:

\`\`\`asm

The \`0.25f\` lives in a read-only float pool (loaded with \`lfs\`), and the divide

# Why the parameter type matters

Here is a common decompilation pitfall worth recognizing. Suppose the target is a
small single-precision helper:

\`\`\`asm
lfs   f0, ...      # load 0.5f
fmuls f1, f0, f1   # x * 0.5f
blr
\`\`\`

Three instructions. Now watch what happens if you write the helper taking a
\`double\` and returning a \`float\` — \`f32 fn(double x){ return x * 0.5; }\`:

\`\`\`asm
lfd   f0, ...      # load 0.5 as a *double*
fmul  f1, f0, f1   # double multiply
frsp  f1, f1       # ROUND result back down to single  ← spurious!
blr
\`\`\`

The compiler did the math in double precision, then had to **\`frsp\`** (round to
single precision) to produce the \`f32\` return value. That extra \`frsp\` — and the
\`fmul\`/\`lfd\` instead of \`fmuls\`/\`lfs\` — will never match a target built from a
clean single-precision helper.

**A good default:** for single-precision helpers, write \`f32 fn(f32)\` rather than
\`f32 fn(double)\` (or \`double fn(double)\`). Keeping everything in \`f32\` keeps the math single
precision and the \`frsp\` disappears.

# Float literals don't fit in an immediate

There is no "load immediate float" instruction — a 32-bit constant can't be

The \`...\` is a relocation the linker fills in; in the disassembler you'll see a
concrete SDA-relative offset off \`r2\`, e.g. \`lfs f0, 0x25f0(r2)\` (or a symbolic
\`lfs f0, lit@sda21(r2)\`). When you spot \`lfs\` feeding straight into an

# One instruction for \`a * b + c\`

PowerPC has a **fused multiply-add**: it multiplies and adds in a single
rounding step. With \`fp_contract\` **on** (it is, in this environment), MWCC will
contract a \`multiply followed by add\` into one **\`fmadds\`**:

\`\`\`asm
fmadds f1, f1, f2, f3   # f1 = a * b + c, single precision, one rounding

Read the operand order carefully: \`fmadds fD, fA, fC, fB\` computes
\`fD = (fA * fC) + fB\`. So in \`fmadds f1, f1, f2, f3\`, the multiply is \`f1 * f2\`

This is a key floating-point idiom to recognize. If you write the three steps

# There is no plain "int → float" instruction

PowerPC's only integer/float conversion hardware is \`fctiwz\` (float → int). To go
the *other* way, MWCC uses a famous bit-twiddling trick. It builds a double whose
bit pattern is \`0x43300000:(x ^ 0x80000000)\` and then subtracts the matching bias
constant \`0x4330000000000000\`, leaving the integer value as a float:

\`\`\`asm
xoris r3, r3, 0x8000   # flip the sign bit (handle signedness)
lis   r0, 0x4330       # high half of the magic double

stw   r0, 8(r1)
lfd   f0, 8(r1)        # reload it as a double
fsubs f1, f0, f1       # subtract the bias → the converted value
blr
\`\`\`

PowerPC is **big-endian**, so the high word sits at the *lower* address: \`8(r1)\`
holds \`0x43300000\` and \`12(r1)\` holds \`x ^ 0x80000000\`. The two \`stw\`s together
lay down the 8-byte double \`0x43300000:(x ^ 0x80000000)\`, which \`lfd f0, 8(r1)\`
then reads back.

# \`fctiwz\` produces the bits in an FPR

Converting a float to an integer uses **\`fctiwz\`** ("convert to integer word,
round toward zero"). But there's a catch: the result lands in a *floating-point*
register, and there is no direct FPR→GPR move. So MWCC stores the FPR to the
stack and loads the low word back into a GPR:

\`\`\`asm
fctiwz f0, f1        # convert x, result in low half of f0
stfd   f0, 8(r1)     # spill the 8-byte FPR to the stack

That \`fctiwz\` → \`stfd\` → \`lwz\` is the unmistakable signature of a \`(int)\` cast

FPR; because PowerPC is big-endian, that low word lives at the *higher* address,

# The compare-then-branch rule

When a float comparison feeds an \`if\`, MWCC uses **\`fcmpo\`** (floating compare,
ordered) to set a condition register, then branches on it. Comparing against
\`0.0f\` first loads the constant with \`lfs\`:

\`\`\`asm

\`\`\`

A reliable rule of thumb: **a float compare that feeds a
branch is just the plain operator** — write \`if (x < 0.0f)\` and you get
\`fcmpo\` + branch. (A float comparison whose *boolean result is stored or
returned* compiles to a different, messier form — the compiler still does the
\`fcmpo\`, but then *materializes* the 0/1 result into a GPR, typically with an
\`mfcr\` plus \`rlwinm\` to extract and shift the condition bit. If you see the
compare's result land in a general register rather than steer a branch, the
original C stored or returned the boolean — so reach for the plain branch shape
first.) "Ordered" (\`fcmpo\`) vs "unordered" matters only for NaN handling;
normal C comparisons use \`fcmpo\`.
