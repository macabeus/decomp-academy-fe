    brief: `
# Width is encoded in the load

A register is 32 bits wide, but memory comes in bytes, halfwords, and words. The
*type* you read through decides which load instruction MWCC emits. Reading a
**\`u8\`** uses **\`lbz\`** — *load byte and zero* — which fetches one byte and clears
the upper 24 bits:

\`\`\`asm
lbz  r3, 0(r3)   ; r3 = (u32) p[0], high 24 bits = 0
blr
\`\`\`

The "z" in \`lbz\` is the whole story: an unsigned byte is **zero-extended**, so no
extra instruction is needed to clean up the register. The pointer arrives in
\`r3\`; the loaded value lands right back in \`r3\` ready to return.

# Halfwords load with \`lhz\`

A **\`u16\`** is two bytes — a *halfword*. Reading one uses **\`lhz\`** — *load
halfword and zero* — the 16-bit sibling of \`lbz\`. It clears the top 16 bits:

\`\`\`asm
lhz  r3, 0(r3)   ; r3 = (u32) p[0], high 16 bits = 0
blr
\`\`\`

Just like the byte case, *unsigned* means *zero-extended*, so \`lhz\` does the
whole job in one instruction. Memorize the family: \`lbz\` for unsigned bytes,
\`lhz\` for unsigned halfwords, \`lwz\` for full words.

# When the high bits must be filled with the sign

Reading a **signed** narrow value into a 32-bit register can't just zero the top
bits — a negative \`s8\` like \`-1\` (\`0xFF\`) must become \`0xFFFFFFFF\`. PowerPC has
a dedicated **\`lha\`** (*load halfword algebraic*) that sign-extends a halfword as
it loads:

\`\`\`asm
lha  r3, 0(r3)   ; r3 = (s32) p[0], sign-extended

\`\`\`

Bytes are the odd one out: there is **no** "load byte algebraic". A signed byte
that needs widening loads with \`lbz\` and is then fixed up with a separate
**\`extsb\`** (*extend sign byte*). You'll see that pair when an \`s8\` is widened to
an \`int\`:

lbz   r3, 0(r3)
extsb r3, r3     ; sign-extend the byte to 32 bits

# \`stb\` writes only the low 8 bits

Storing is simpler than loading: there is no signed/unsigned distinction, only
*width*. Writing through a **\`u8*\`** uses **\`stb\`** (*store byte*), which copies
only the **low 8 bits** of the source register to memory:

\`\`\`asm
stb  r4, 0(r3)   ; p[0] = (u8) v   (high bits of r4 ignored)

The pointer \`p\` is in \`r3\`, the value \`v\` is in \`r4\`. \`stb\` silently **truncates**
— whatever sits in the upper 24 bits of \`r4\` is discarded. That truncation is
"free": the compiler doesn't mask the value first, it just narrows the store.

    brief: `
# The single most common byte-matching mistake

In MWCC's world, a plain **\`char\` is signed**. That one fact bites constantly.
Whenever a \`char\` value is *promoted* — passed to a function, used in arithmetic,
returned as \`int\` — the compiler must sign-extend it first with an **\`extsb\`**.
A **\`u8\`** never sign-extends, because it is already unsigned.

Watch what happens when a byte is loaded and handed to a function that takes an
\`int\`. With \`char\`, an extra \`extsb\` appears:

\`\`\`asm
lbz   r3, 0(r4)
extsb r3, r3      ; <-- spurious: char promotes to signed int
bl    scale
stb   r3, 0(r31)
\`\`\`

With **\`u8\`**, the loaded byte feeds the call directly — the \`extsb\` is **gone**:

\`\`\`asm
lbz   r3, 0(r4)
bl    scale       ; no extsb: u8 is already zero-extended
stb   r3, 0(r31)
\`\`\`

If your output has one stray \`extsb\` the target doesn't, the cause is almost
always a \`char\` that should have been a \`u8\`. This is the golden rule of this
chapter: **use \`u8\` for a raw byte, never \`char\`.**

# Same value, two ways to fill the top bits

Widening a narrow *value already in a register* (not a fresh load) shows the
sign/unsigned split clearly. A **\`u8 → u32\`** widen zero-extends with a
rotate-mask, printed as **\`clrlwi\`** (clear left word immediate) — here clearing
the top 24 bits:

\`\`\`asm
clrlwi r3, r3, 24   ; keep low 8 bits, zero the rest

\`clrlwi r3, r3, 24\` and \`extsb r3, r3\` differ only in whether the high bits become
zeros or copies of the sign bit — exactly the unsigned-vs-signed choice. (For
this lesson we widen the *unsigned* case.)

# \`& 0xFF\` is the same as keeping the low byte

When you narrow a wide value *without* storing it — e.g. returning the low byte
of an \`int\` — the compiler can't lean on a narrow store. Instead it masks the
register. \`x & 0xFF\` keeps the low 8 bits and clears the rest, which is again the
\`clrlwi\` rotate-mask:

\`\`\`asm
clrlwi r3, r3, 24   ; x & 0xFF

This is the *register-resident* twin of the truncating store from earlier: \`stb\`
truncates on its way to memory, while \`& 0xFF\` truncates a value staying in a
register. Both keep the low 8 bits; recognizing \`clrlwi ..., 24\` as "really"
\`& 0xFF\` (and \`..., 16\` as \`& 0xFFFF\`) is a core reading skill.

# An explicit cast can be a whole instruction

A cast isn't always free. Casting a wide signed value *down* to a signed narrow
type and back up forces the value through that narrow range, which means
sign-extending from the cast width. \`(s8)x\` keeps the low byte but re-spreads its
sign bit, exactly **\`extsb\`**:

\`\`\`asm

# Widening a signed type keeps its sign

Converting between two *signed* widths follows the value's own sign. Promoting an

# \`cmplwi\` vs \`cmpwi\` is a type tell

When a value feeds a *branch*, the comparison opcode reveals its declared type.
An **unsigned** operand (like a \`u16\`) compares with **\`cmplwi\`** — *compare
**l**ogical word immediate* — after being zero-extended to clear the high bits:

\`\`\`asm

cmplwi r0, 256      ; unsigned compare

A **signed narrow** operand of the same width (an \`s16\`) compares with
**\`cmpwi\`** — the signed compare — preceded by a sign-extend. (A plain 32-bit
\`int\` is already full-width, so it gets the \`cmpwi\` with *no* extend.)

The difference is one letter — \`cmpl**w**i\` vs \`cmp**w**i\` — and the preceding
