# A comparison with no branch in sight

When a function *returns* \`a == b\`, the result is a 0/1 integer, not a jump.
MWCC has a slick branchless idiom for equality. It subtracts the two values —
the difference is zero exactly when they're equal — then counts the leading
zero bits and shifts:

\`\`\`asm
subf   r0, r3, r4    # r0 = b - a   (zero iff a == b)
cntlzw r0, r0        # count leading zeros: 32 if r0==0, else < 32
srwi   r3, r0, 5     # r0 >> 5  ==  1 if it was 32, else 0
blr
\`\`\`

The trick: \`cntlzw\` returns **32** only for an all-zero word, and \`32 >> 5\` is
\`1\`; any non-zero difference counts fewer than 32 leading zeros, so \`>> 5\` gives
\`0\`. That \`subf\` → \`cntlzw\` → \`srwi r3, r0, 5\` trio is MWCC's signature for
"return \`a == b\`".

    brief: `
# Inequality flips the recipe

\`a != b\` can't reuse the \`cntlzw\` trick directly — it needs a *non-zero* test
instead of a *zero* test. MWCC computes the difference both ways, ORs them, and
extracts the sign bit of the combination:

\`\`\`asm
subf r5, r3, r4    # b - a
subf r0, r4, r3    # a - b
or   r0, r5, r0    # nonzero (with bit 31 set somewhere) iff a != b
srwi r3, r0, 31    # pull bit 31 down to 0/1
blr
\`\`\`

ORing \`b - a\` with \`a - b\` guarantees the top bit is set whenever the two
differ (at least one of the two subtractions has bit 31 set), and is exactly
zero when they match. The final \`srwi r3, r0, 31\` isolates that sign bit as a
clean \`0\`/\`1\`. (Edge case: when \`a - b\` wraps to \`INT_MIN\`, \`b - a\` wraps to
\`INT_MIN\` too, but the OR is still \`INT_MIN\` so bit 31 stays set and the result
is still correct.)

    brief: `
# When a comparison drives control flow

Returning *different constants* from the two arms of an \`if\`/\`else\` is the
first time you'll see a real **compare-and-branch**. The comparison no longer
produces a number — it sets the condition register, and a branch reads it:

\`\`\`asm
cmpw  r3, r4      # compare a against b, set cr0
li    r3, 20      # assume the else value first
bnelr-            # if a != b, return now with 20
li    r3, 10      # otherwise overwrite with the then value
blr
\`\`\`

First, that trailing \`-\` on \`bnelr-\` is a branch-prediction hint, not an
operand. Then two things to notice. MWCC **speculatively loads the else value**
(\`20\`) before the branch, so the equal case is the one that falls through and
reloads. And \`bnelr\` is a *conditional return* — "branch to link register if
not equal" — collapsing an entire else-arm into one instruction.

    brief: `
# A guard that compiles to no branch at all

\`if (x < 0) return 0;\` looks like it needs a comparison and a jump. But
clamping a signed value up to zero is a classic branchless trick MWCC knows by
heart, built from an arithmetic shift and an *and-with-complement*:

\`\`\`asm
srawi r0, r3, 31   # r0 = all 1s if x < 0, else all 0s (sign mask)
andc  r3, r3, r0   # r3 = x AND (NOT mask) -> 0 if x<0, else x
blr
\`\`\`

\`srawi r0, r3, 31\` smears the sign bit across the whole word, producing
\`0xFFFFFFFF\` for negatives and \`0\` for non-negatives. \`andc\` then masks \`x\`
against the *inverse*: negatives become \`0\`, everything else passes through
untouched. No \`cmpwi\`, no branch — pure data flow.

Why branchless? MWCC recognises the clamp shape when both paths return a value
derived from the *same* register, and folds it into this \`srawi\`/\`andc\` pair.
The single-return form \`return x < 0 ? 0 : x;\` is recognised identically. Beware
that the logically equivalent inversion \`if (x >= 0) return x; return 0;\` falls
*outside* the recognised pattern and compiles to a different sequence — source
form can decide codegen.

    brief: `
# The type chooses the opcode

When a comparison feeds a branch, PowerPC has *two* compare instructions, and
the C **type** decides which one. For a signed \`int\`, MWCC emits **\`cmpw\`** —
the signed word compare:

\`\`\`asm
cmpw  r3, r4      # signed compare: treats r3, r4 as signed
li    r3, 200     # else value
bgelr-            # if a >= b, return 200
li    r3, 100     # then value
blr
\`\`\`

\`cmpw\` orders operands the way you'd expect for signed numbers: \`-1\` is *less
than* \`1\`. The condition test \`bgelr\` ("branch if greater-or-equal") reads the
signed ordering. This lesson is one half of a pair — the next swaps the types to
unsigned and watches the opcode change.

Take the *exact same* \`if (a < b)\` logic from the previous lesson and change the
operands to \`u32\`. The structure is identical — but the compare becomes
**\`cmplw\`**, the *logical* (unsigned) word compare:

cmplw r3, r4      # UNSIGNED compare
li    r3, 200
bgelr-

\`\`\`

Why it matters: under unsigned ordering \`0xFFFFFFFF\` is the *largest* value, not
\`-1\`. Pick the wrong compare and a value like \`0xFFFFFFFF\` lands on the wrong
side of the branch. **The types in your C are what select \`cmpw\` vs \`cmplw\`** —
if your match shows \`cmplw\` but you wrote \`int\`, the original local or field was
unsigned. Spotting this mismatch — \`cmplw\` where you expected \`cmpw\` — is one of
the most useful debugging skills in decompilation: it points straight back to the
original type.

# Constant compares get the immediate forms

Comparing against a literal folds the constant into the instruction, just like
arithmetic immediates. And the signed/unsigned split persists: a signed \`int\`

A signed \`if (a > 5)\` returning two values:

The unsigned twin (\`u32 a\`) is the same shape with **\`cmplwi r3, 5\`** in line
one. Same rule as the register compares: the operand's type, not the constant,
chooses the opcode. Keep typing your locals and fields to the real field width

# Bailing out before the real work

A **guard clause** checks a precondition and returns early so the rest of the
function can assume it holds. Because the two arms do genuinely different work
(return a constant vs. perform a divide), MWCC keeps a real branch here rather
than going branchless:

\`\`\`asm
cmpwi r4, 0       # is the divisor zero?
bne-  .body       # no -> skip the guard, go do the work

The guard's body (\`li r3, -1\`; \`blr\`) sits inline right after the branch, and
the "real" code follows at the \`bne-\` target. Spotting a lone compare whose

# Selecting the larger of two

The ternary \`a > b ? a : b\` is just \`max(a, b)\`. MWCC compiles it to a compare,
a conditional skip, and a pair of moves that funnel the chosen value into the
return register:

cmpw r3, r4      # compare a, b (signed int)

# Two compares, lazily evaluated

C's \`&&\` and \`||\` are **short-circuit**: the second operand is only evaluated if
the first didn't already decide the answer. That laziness shows up directly as
*two separate compares with branches between them*. For \`a > 0 && b > 0\`:

\`\`\`asm
cmpwi r3, 0
ble-  .false     # a <= 0 -> whole && is false, skip the b test

With \`&&\`, the *first* failing test jumps straight to the false exit — \`b\` is
never compared when \`a <= 0\`. \`||\` inverts the logic: the first *passing* test
jumps to the true exit. The same \`a > 0 || b > 0\` compiles to:

\`\`\`asm
cmpwi r3, 0

# How MWCC lays out a switch

A \`switch\` over a handful of cases doesn't always become a jump table. For a
small dense set, MWCC builds a **binary-search compare chain** — it bisects the
case values with signed compares to reach the right arm in a logarithmic number
of tests:

\`\`\`asm
cmpwi r3, 2       # probe the middle case first
beq-  .case2
bge-  .hi         # x > 2 -> search the upper half
cmpwi r3, 0       # lower half: 0 or 1?
beq-  .case0
bge-  .case1
b     .default
.hi:
cmpwi r3, 4       # upper half: 3, or out of range?
bge-  .default
b     .case3
\`\`\`

Each \`.caseN\` is a tiny \`li r3, <value>\` / \`blr\` block, and anything that falls
through every test lands in \`.default\`. Note the cases are tested **in value
order**, not source order — the compiler sorts them to bisect. A cascade of
\`cmpwi\`/\`beq\`/\`bge\` against ascending constants is the unmistakable shape of a
dense \`switch\`. This compare-chain strategy is specific to small case sets;
larger dense switches (roughly 5+ cases) flip to a jump table (a \`b\` through a
computed table address), a pattern a later lesson covers.
