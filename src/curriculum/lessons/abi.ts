# Where the arguments live

The GameCube ABI hands the first eight integer (or pointer) arguments to a
function in registers **\`r3\`, \`r4\`, \`r5\`, \`r6\`, \`r7\`, \`r8\`, \`r9\`, \`r10\`** — in
that order. The first argument is in \`r3\`, the second in \`r4\`, and so on.

A function that simply returns its **fourth** argument therefore just copies
\`r6\` into the return register \`r3\`:

\`\`\`asm
mr   r3, r6      ; r3 = the 4th argument
blr
\`\`\`

\`mr\` ("move register") is \`r3 = r6\`. The other three arguments arrive in
\`r3\`–\`r5\` but go unused, so they generate no code at all. Knowing the
argument-to-register mapping by heart lets you read any function signature
straight off its first few instructions.

# Counting up to r7

The mapping keeps going past the first few registers. The fifth integer
argument lives in **\`r7\`** (r3=1st, r4=2nd, r5=3rd, r6=4th, r7=5th). A function
that adds its first and fifth arguments reads exactly that:

\`\`\`asm
add  r3, r3, r7   ; 1st arg + 5th arg
blr
\`\`\`

The compiler never moved anything into place — \`a\` was already in \`r3\` and \`e\`
was already in \`r7\`, so a single \`add\` does the whole job. When you see an
operation between \`r3\` and \`r7\` with nothing loaded first, it's almost always
the 1st and 5th parameters.

# A separate file for floating point

Floating-point arguments do **not** share the \`r3\`–\`r10\` integer registers.
They have their own bank: the first eight \`float\`/\`double\` arguments go in
**\`f1\`, \`f2\`, … \`f8\`**, and a floating-point result comes back in **\`f1\`**.

Single-precision \`f32\` math uses the \`...s\` ("single") forms, so summing three
floats is two \`fadds\`:

fadds f0, f1, f2   ; a + b  (into scratch f0)
fadds f1, f3, f0   ; + c, result in the return reg f1

final result lands in \`f1\`, the float return register — the mirror of \`r3\` on

# The cheapest function shape

A **leaf** function is one that calls nothing. Because it makes no calls, it
never has to preserve the **link register** (the return address) and it needs no
scratch storage that outlives a call — so MWCC gives it **no stack frame at
all**. There is no prologue and no epilogue; the body runs and returns:

Compare this to what you'll see next lesson. The complete absence of
\`stwu r1,...\` / \`mflr\` / \`mtlr\` is the signature of a leaf: everything happens
in volatile registers (\`r3\`–\`r12\`, \`f0\`–\`f13\`) that a function may freely

# What it costs to call another function

The moment a function **calls** something, its shape changes completely. A call
(\`bl\`) overwrites the **link register** \`lr\` with the address to come back to —
so before our function can call out, it must save its *own* return address
somewhere safe. That somewhere is a **stack frame**.

\`\`\`asm
stwu r1, -16(r1)   ; PROLOGUE: push a 16-byte frame (r1 is the stack pointer)
mflr r0            ; r0 = our return address (the link register)
stw  r0, 20(r1)    ; save it into the caller's frame, above our own
bl   compute       ; call compute(x) — this trashes lr, but we saved it
lwz  r0, 20(r1)    ; EPILOGUE: reload our return address
addi r3, r3, 1     ; compute(x) + 1
mtlr r0            ; restore lr
addi r1, r1, 16    ; pop the frame
blr                ; return

Every non-leaf function wears this prologue/epilogue. \`stwu r1, -N(r1)\` both
allocates the frame and links it to the caller's; \`mflr\`/\`stw\` save the return
address on the way in; \`lwz\`/\`mtlr\`/\`addi r1\` undo it all on the way out. Learn
to read past this boilerplate to find the real work in the middle.

# Filling r3, r4, … before you branch

To call a function you must place its arguments into the same \`r3\`, \`r4\`, \`r5\`…
slots the callee will read. This is **argument marshalling**. When you call
\`combine(x, x + 1)\`, the compiler must get \`x\` into \`r3\` and \`x + 1\` into \`r4\`
before the \`bl\`:

\`\`\`asm
stwu r1, -16(r1)
mflr r0

Crucially, \`x\` arrived in \`r3\` and the *first* argument also goes in \`r3\`, so it
needs no move — the compiler computes the second argument into \`r4\` and leaves

    brief: `
# Values that must outlive a call

A function call may clobber any **volatile** register (\`r3\`–\`r12\`). So if a value
has to still be around *after* a call returns, the compiler can't leave it in a
volatile register — it moves it into a **non-volatile** (callee-saved) register,
\`r14\`–\`r31\`, which the ABI promises any callee will preserve. MWCC fills these
from the top down, so the first such value goes in **\`r31\`**.

Here \`y\` must survive the \`side(x)\` call so it can be returned afterwards:

\`\`\`asm
stwu r1, -16(r1)
mflr r0
stw  r0, 20(r1)
stw  r31, 12(r1)   ; save the caller's r31 — we're about to borrow it
mr   r31, r4       ; park y (r4) in non-volatile r31
bl   side          ; side(x); r3..r12 may be destroyed, but r31 is safe
mr   r3, r31       ; recover y for the return value
lwz  r31, 12(r1)   ; restore the caller's r31
... epilogue ...
blr
\`\`\`

Two new instructions join the prologue/epilogue: \`stw r31, 12(r1)\` saves the
incoming value of \`r31\` (so we can hand it back untouched), and the matching
\`lwz r31, 12(r1)\` restores it. Seeing a \`stw r31\` paired with a \`mr r31, ...\`

# A rule that decides r31 vs r30

When **two** values must survive calls, both get non-volatile homes — the first
in \`r31\`, the second in \`r30\` (MWCC allocates downward from the top). Which
value is "first"? It is set by the **order the locals are declared** in your C:
the first-declared surviving local takes the highest register, \`r31\`.

In \`order_demo\`, \`first\` is declared before \`second\`:

\`\`\`asm
stw  r31, 12(r1)
stw  r30, 8(r1)
mr   r30, r4         ; y parked for the second call

mr   r3, r30

subf r3, r3, r31     ; first - second
\`\`\`

Now the decompiler's lever: **if the target had \`first\` in r30 and \`second\` in
r31, you'd simply swap the two declarations.** Reordering
\`int first; int second;\` to \`int second; int first;\` flips their register
homes — \`second\` would take \`r31\` and \`first\` would take \`r30\` — with no change
to the program's meaning. Register coloring you can't otherwise reach is often
just a declaration-order edit away.

Only the first **eight** integer arguments get registers (\`r3\`–\`r10\`). A
