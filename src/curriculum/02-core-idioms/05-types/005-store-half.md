title: Storing a Halfword
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - stores
  - truncation
symbol: store_u16
hints:
  - Writing one halfword uses `sth` (store halfword).
  - "`p[0] = v;` compiles to `sth r4, 0(r3)`."

# `sth` is the 16-bit store

Writing a halfword goes through **`sth`** (*store halfword*), which lays down the
**low 16 bits** of a register and nothing above them:

```asm
sth  r4, 6(r3)   # table[3] = val
blr
```

The example above writes index 3 of a `u16` array, which lands six bytes in, with
the pointer in `r3` and the value in `r4`.

Every store has a twin among the loads at the same width, so alongside `sth` you
get `stb` down at the byte level and `stw` up at the full word. Sign never enters
into it, since a store only truncates its operand to the right width and copies it
across. When you do need a signed value back, that work falls to the *load* later
on, never the store.

## Your task

Write `store_u16`, taking a `u16*` and a `u16`, to produce a single `sth`.

<!-- starter -->
```c
void store_u16(u16* p, u16 v) {
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
void store_u16(u16* p, u16 v) {
    p[0] = v;
}
```
