title: Combining Fields Across Nested Structs
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - structs
  - nested
  - offsets
  - chaining
symbol: AABB_spanX
hints:
  - Both loads use the same base; one field lives in the first inner struct, the
    other in the second, so their offsets are a whole inner-struct apart.
  - Add `offsetof(outer, member) + offsetof(inner, field)` for each access, then
    combine the two loads.

# Reaching into two inner structs

You just saw a `.a.b` access boil down to one offset. Two of them isn't any
harder, even when each one lives in a separate inner struct of the same outer
struct. The field you want still has exactly one absolute offset. You get it by
adding where the inner struct starts to where the field sits inside it. After
that the two loads just combine, same as any other pair of fields.

Put two of the same inner type back to back and the second one starts a whole
inner-struct later. Here's a range built out of two `Pair`s:

```c
typedef struct { int a; int b; } Pair;
typedef struct { Pair lo; Pair hi; } Range;

int Range_sumB(Range* r) {
    return r->lo.b + r->hi.b;
}
```

`lo` starts at offset 0. `hi` comes right after it at offset 8, past the 8-byte
`Pair`. And `b` is always +4 into a `Pair`, so `lo.b` works out to 4 and `hi.b`
to `8 + 4 = 12`:

```asm
lwz   r4, 4(r3)     # r->lo.b   (0 + 4)
lwz   r0, 12(r3)    # r->hi.b   (8 + 4)
add   r3, r4, r0
blr
```

See how the two displacements are exactly `sizeof(Pair)` apart? That's the
giveaway. It's one field, read out of two inner structs sitting side by side. To
take a pair of loads like this apart, peel each offset into the inner struct it
picks and the field it lands on.

Your target pulls a field from each inner struct and joins them with a different
operation. Peel each offset into outer plus inner, then put the combine back
together.

## Your task

With the structs above, write `AABB_spanX` to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int AABB_spanX(AABB* b) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int AABB_spanX(AABB* b) {
    return b->max.x - b->min.x;
}
```

<!-- context -->
```c
typedef struct { int x; int y; } Point;
typedef struct { Point min; Point max; } AABB;
```
