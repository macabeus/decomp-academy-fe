# Chaining off a multiply

Recall `mullw rD, rA, rB` computes `rA * rB` — *multiply low word*, keeping the
low 32 bits, matching C `int` multiplication. Its operand order is
straightforward: no reversal, no surprises.

When multiplication is followed by a second operation, the pattern looks like
the chains you have already seen: `mullw` writes an intermediate result into a
scratch register, and the next instruction picks it up.

As an example, consider `scale_offset(p, q, r)`, which scales two values and then
shifts by a third:

```asm
mullw r0, r3, r4   # r0 = p * q
subf  r3, r5, r0   # r3 = r0 - r5  =  (p * q) - r
blr
```

`mullw` stores the product in `r0`. The `subf` then reads `r0` as its minuend and
subtracts `r5` from it. (Recall: `subf rD, rA, rB` computes `rB − rA`, so
`subf r3, r5, r0` gives `r0 − r5`.)

The target assembly for this lesson uses a different second operation. Read the
target asm above — identify what `mullw` produces, then determine what the
following instruction does with that product.

## Your task

Write `muladd3`, taking three `int`s, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int muladd3(int a, int b, int c) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int muladd3(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a * b + c;
}
```
