title: Combining Two Arrays at the Same Index
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - loads
  - indexed-addressing
  - arrays
  - chaining
symbol: dot1
hints:
  - The same variable index scales once, then drives an indexed load from each of
    the two base pointers.
  - One `slwi`, then two `lwzx` sharing the scaled offset register, then a combine.

# One offset, two bases

Index two arrays by the *same* variable and the compiler computes the scaled
byte offset once, then leans on it twice. `i*size` ends up in a single register.
Each `lwzx` then pairs that offset with its own base pointer, and the two array
bases show up in `r3` and `r4`. It's the clearest demonstration that an indexed
load wants *two* register operands. Freeze the offset, swap the base, and you're
walking a second array.

`add_arrays(x, y, j)` reads `x[j]` and `y[j]`, then adds them:

```asm
slwi r0, r5, 2    # j * 4   (j is the third arg, in r5)
lwzx r3, r3, r0   # x[j]    (base x in r3 + offset)
lwzx r0, r4, r0   # y[j]    (base y in r4 + same offset)
add  r3, r3, r0   # x[j] + y[j]
blr
```

A lone `slwi` scales `j`. The offset sits in `r0` and drives both `lwzx`
instructions; only the base register differs between the two. Your target also
combines two arrays at the shared index, but with a different operation. Check
the instruction right after the two `lwzx` to find out which.

## Your task

Write `dot1`, taking two `int*` and an `int`, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int dot1(int* a, int* b, int i) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int dot1(int* a, int* b, int i) {
    return a[i] * b[i];
}
```
