title: Setting a Single Flag Bit
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - bitwise
  - or
  - flags
symbol: set_flag
hints:
  - Setting a flag means OR-ing in its bit and keeping the rest.
  - "`x |= 0x40` is the same as `x = x | 0x40` → one `ori`."
  - 0x40 is a single bit (bit 6), so a power-of-two immediate appears.
  - In real code a lone `ori` with a power-of-two immediate usually means the
    source used a named constant (`#define SOME_FLAG 0x40`); writing the
    constant compiles identically.

# The `|=` idiom for flags

Game code overflows with flag words, every bit standing for some piece of state,
*visible*, *active*, *dirty*. Setting one of those flags means OR-ing in a
single-bit mask, and in C that almost always shows up as the compound assignment
`x |= mask`.

Set bit 3, the mask `0x08`, and it collapses to one `ori`:

```asm
ori  r3, r3, 8
blr
```

The reason `|=` earns its keep is that it leaves every *other* flag exactly where
it was; only the bit you aimed at moves. So when you spot a lone `ori` carrying a
power-of-two immediate, the source behind it was almost certainly `flags |=
SOME_FLAG;`.

The target below sets a different flag. Work out which power of two the immediate
stands for, then write the compound assignment that flips it on.

```asm
ori  r3, r3, 64
blr
```

## Your task

Write `set_flag` so it compiles to the `ori` above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
u32 set_flag(u32 x) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
u32 set_flag(u32 x) {
    x |= 0x40;
    return x;
}
```
