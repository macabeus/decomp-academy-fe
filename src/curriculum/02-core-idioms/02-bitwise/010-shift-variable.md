title: Shifting by a Variable Amount
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - bitwise
  - shifts
  - variable-shift
  - slw
symbol: shl_var
hints:
  - A runtime shift amount can't fold into `rlwinm` — it uses the register-form
    shift.
  - "`x << n` with `n` in a register compiles to `slw r3, r3, r4`."

# When the shift count is a register

Up to now every shift moved by a *constant*, which is exactly why MWCC could fold
the count into an `rlwinm` (`slwi`/`srwi`) or an `srawi`. A *runtime* amount
leaves nothing to fold. PowerPC keeps separate register-shift opcodes for that
case, each one reading its count out of a second register. Here's a logical right
shift by a variable amount:

```asm
srw     r3,r3,r4
blr
```

These three track the constant forms by sign. `slw` shifts left, `srw` shifts
right logically for unsigned values, and `sraw` shifts right algebraically for
signed ones. The signed-versus-unsigned rule hasn't changed at all; the one new
wrinkle is that the count rides in a register rather than inside the instruction.

Spot any of `slw`/`srw`/`sraw` with no trailing `i` and you know the shift
distance came from a variable in the source. Take the direction and sign straight
from the mnemonic, and let the second argument carry the count.

## Your task

Write `shl_var` to match the target.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int shl_var(int x, int n) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int shl_var(int x, int n) {
    return x << n;
}
```
