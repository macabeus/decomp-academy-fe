difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - floating-point
  - fmadds
  - fcmpo
  - clamp
  - capstone
  - highlight
symbol: slider_approach
hints:
  - The arithmetic before the compare is a lerp — an `fsubs` (difference) feeding
    an `fmadds` (`base + diff*amount`), with one `fmuls` building the amount.
  - The `fcmpo` + conditional branch + `fmr` is a one-sided clamp on the
    result; a single `stfs` writes it back.
  - Keep everything in one running local so it stays in a float register from the
    arithmetic through the clamp to the store.

# Bringing the chapter together

Here's the capstone, and it leans on nearly the whole chapter at once. Struct
fields loaded without touching the constant pool. A chained multiply. The lerp
idiom, `fsubs` into `fmadds`. A one-branch clamp out of `fcmpo` and `fmr`. A
store to close it off. Read the fields, interpolate toward a target, clamp, write
back. That is the per-frame update pattern game actor code is built from.

Take `body_step(b, dt)`. It nudges a position forward by a drag-scaled velocity
and refuses to let it drop below zero:

```asm
lfs   f0, 8(r3)      # b->drag
lfs   f2, 4(r3)      # b->vel
fmuls f1, f0, f1     # drag * dt
lfs   f3, 0(r3)      # b->pos
lfs   f0, ...        # load 0.0f
fmuls f1, f2, f1     # vel * (drag * dt)
fadds f1, f3, f1     # pos + that
fcmpo cr0, f1, f0    # result < 0 ?
bge-  .ok            #   skip clamp when >= 0
fmr   f1, f0         #   result = 0
.ok:
stfs  f1, 0(r3)      # b->pos = result
blr
```

Notice that nothing ever leaves `f1`. The products pile up there, the `fadds`
brings in the base, and the `fcmpo`/`bge-`/`fmr` run clamps the floor. Then
`stfs` writes that final value straight back into the struct. The branch is
testing the *inverted* `if`, so `bge-` is what skips the `if (result < 0)` body.
And there is exactly one `stfs`. One store, nothing more.

On to the target, `slider_approach`. The math ahead of the compare is the
**lerp idiom** you have already met. You are looking for an `fsubs` taking a
difference, an `fmadds` shaping `base + diff * amount`, and an `fmuls` putting
that amount together. Past the compare, the `fcmpo` operands and the branch
condition name the field that bounds the result, and the `stfs` offset says where
the answer goes.

Its one argument points at this struct:

```c
typedef struct { f32 value; f32 target; f32 rate; } Slider;
```

## Your task

<!-- context -->
```c
typedef struct { f32 value; f32 target; f32 rate; } Slider;
```

With the `Slider` struct above, write `slider_approach` taking a `Slider*` and an
`f32 dt` to reproduce the assembly above. Compute the interpolated step into one
local, clamp it against the relevant field, and store it back.

<!-- starter -->
```c
void slider_approach(Slider* s, f32 dt) {
    // step value toward target by (rate * dt); clamp so it doesn't overshoot;
    // store back into value
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
void slider_approach(Slider* s, f32 dt) {
    f32 v = s->value + (s->target - s->value) * (s->rate * dt);
    if (v > s->target) {
        v = s->target;
    }
    s->value = v;
}
```
