title: Mixing Add and Subtract in One Chain
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - floating-point
  - chaining
  - operand-order
symbol: net3
hints:
  - The scratch register from the first step becomes the *left* operand of the
    `fsubs`, because `fsubs` keeps natural order.
  - Watch which argument is subtracted — `fsubs fD, fA, fB` is `fA - fB`.

# A subtract that keeps its order, mid-chain

The integer `subf` flips its operands on you. `fsubs` doesn't. It just computes
`fD = fA - fB`, left to right, no surprises. That plain ordering matters most
mid-chain, where you have to stay clear on which value is being subtracted from
which.

Say `delta(p, q, r)` adds the first two arguments, then takes the third away:

```asm
fadds f0, f1, f2   # f0 = p + q
fsubs f1, f0, f3   # f1 = f0 - r  =  (p + q) - r
blr
```

The running total `p + q` sits in `f0`. `fsubs` leaves it on the **left**, so
the result is `(p + q) - r`, not `r - (p + q)`. Swap the instruction to
`fsubs f1, f3, f0` and the math swaps with it. Whatever order you read in the
operands is the order you write in the C.

Same shape in the target, an add feeding a subtract. Read the operand order on
the `fsubs` and you will know which value gets subtracted from which.

## Your task

Write `net3`, taking three `f32`s, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
f32 net3(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c) {
    return 0.0f;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
f32 net3(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c) {
    return a + b - c;
}
```
