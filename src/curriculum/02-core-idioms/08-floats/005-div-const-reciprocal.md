title: Dividing by a Constant Becomes a Multiply
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - floating-point
  - divide
  - reciprocal
  - strength-reduction
symbol: quarter
hints:
  - Dividing by a compile-time constant doesn't use `fdivs` — it folds to a
    reciprocal multiply.
  - Expect an `lfs` of the reciprocal then a single `fmuls`, no division.

# A float divide that isn't a divide

Here's a divide the hardware never performs. Hand MWCC a **power-of-two constant** divisor and it skips `fdivs`. Why? The reciprocal of a power of two is *exactly representable*, so the compiler stores that number and multiplies. One `fmuls`, done. Watch `y / 8.0f`:

```asm
lfs   f0, ...      # load the reciprocal constant 0.125f from the pool
fmuls f1,f1,f0    # y * 0.125f  — no fdivs in sight
blr
```

The constant rides in a read-only float pool. `lfs` fetches it, `fmuls` applies it, and the division is gone. Exactness is the whole game. Powers of two qualify; almost nothing else does. Ask for `y / 3.0f` and the divide comes back as `fdivs`, since `1/3` can't be written exactly in binary.

Spotting `lfs` then `fmuls` in the target? Work back to the power-of-two divisor behind that reciprocal. Write it as a plain division in C and trust the compiler to make the constant. Typing the reciprocal by hand defeats the point.

## Your task

Write `quarter` taking an `f32 x` so it compiles to an `lfs` + `fmuls` pattern.

<!-- starter -->
```c
f32 quarter(f32 x) {
    return 0.0f;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
f32 quarter(f32 x) {
    return x / 4.0f;
}
```
