title: "Capstone: A Guarded, Clamped Update"
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - capstone
  - guard
  - clamp
  - combining
  - branch
symbol: apply_damage
hints:
  - Three stages in a row — a guard, then a clamp on one value, then a clamp on
    another.
  - "`subf.` and `add.` set cr0 as a side effect, so the next branch needs no
    separate compare."

# Tying the chapter together

This last one is a mash-up. The function leans on an **early-return guard** to
drop junk inputs, runs a little arithmetic, then uses **branchless-style clamps**
to keep the answer in bounds. No new instruction appears. The challenge is
recognising machinery you've already built, plus one MWCC habit of welding a
clamp's compare onto the arithmetic that just ran.

The weld hangs on the trailing dot. When a mnemonic carries a `.`, say `add.` or
`subf.`, it updates the condition register as a *side effect* of its real work.
So a freshly computed value that needs clamping skips its own `cmpwi`; the dotted
op already set the flags the branch will test.

In `step(pos, delta, limit)`, a non-positive limit gets ignored outright, `pos`
moves up by `delta`, and the result ends up wedged inside `[0, limit]`:

```asm
cmpwi r5,0         # guard: limit <= 0 ?
blelr-             # yes -> return pos untouched
add.  r3,r3,r4     # pos += delta, and set cr0 from the result
bge-  .check_hi    # result >= 0 -> skip the floor
li    r3,0         # floor: clamp up to 0
.check_hi:
cmpw  r3,r5        # result vs limit
blelr-             # <= limit -> done, return it
mr    r3,r5        # otherwise saturate to limit
blr
```

The `blelr-` near the top is the guard, gone the moment it must be. Right after,
`add.` does the arithmetic and, for free, arms the floor's `bge-`. The tail,
`cmpw` into `blelr-` into `mr`, holds the value under the ceiling. You've coded
each move already; the real exercise is noticing them strung together.

Yours guards and clamps something different, but you read it the same way. The
guard and its return value come first, the working arithmetic sits in the middle,
a clamp or two fences the result at the end. Spot a dotted op pressed against a
branch with no compare in the gap, and the fusion is showing its face again.

## Your task

Write `apply_damage`, taking `hp`, `dmg`, and `armor` (all `int`), to reproduce
the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int apply_damage(int hp, int dmg, int armor) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int apply_damage(int hp, int dmg, int armor) {
    if (hp <= 0) return 0;
    dmg = dmg - armor;
    if (dmg < 0) dmg = 0;
    hp = hp - dmg;
    if (hp < 0) hp = 0;
    return hp;
}
```
