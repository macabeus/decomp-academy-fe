title: Counting Down Is Cheaper
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - countdown
  - induction-variable
  - immediates
symbol: sum
hints:
  - Loop `for (; n > 0; n--)` and accumulate `s += n` — reuse `n` itself as the
    counter.
  - Counting down lets the test be `cmpwi r3, 0` instead of a register compare.
  - The decrement is `addi r3, r3, -1`; the test is `bgt+`.

# Compare against zero, not a bound

Why should the direction of a loop matter to the compiler? Count *up* toward `n`
and the test has to weigh the induction variable against `n`, a
register-to-register `cmpw`. Count *down* toward zero instead and it can weigh
against a flat constant 0 through the immediate form `cmpwi rA, 0`. No register
sits around holding the bound. That trims the loop slightly, and it lets a single
variable be both the counter and the value.

Take `countdown_ex(m)`, which walks `m` down to 1 while piling up double of each
value. What makes it tick is `r3`, the parameter `m`, pulling double duty as the
accumulator index *and* the loop counter, so there's no separate `i` to carry:

```asm
li   r4, 0          # s = 0
b    test
body:
slwi r0, r3, 1      # m * 2
addi r3, r3, -1     # m--
add  r4, r4, r0     # s += m * 2
test:
cmpwi r3, 0         # m > 0 ?  (compare against immediate 0)
bgt+ body
mr   r3, r4
blr
```

That's why heaps of hand-tuned 2002 game code counts down, because `cmpwi rX, 0`
spends no register on a limit. Your `sum` runs a plainer body, no multiply
anywhere. The surrounding loop, though, keeps the bones you already know: a
pre-test `b`, a decrement through `addi r3,r3,-1`, and a `cmpwi r3,0`.

## Your task

Write `sum`, returning `n + (n-1) + ... + 1` by counting **down** from `n`.

<!-- starter -->
```c
#pragma optimization_level 1
int sum(int n) {
    int s = 0;
    // count down from n to 1
    return s;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
#pragma optimization_level 1
int sum(int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for (; n > 0; n--) s += n;
    return s;
}
```
