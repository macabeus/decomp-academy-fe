title: "Do-While: The Tightest Loop"
difficulty: 2
concepts:
  - do-while
  - control-flow
  - branch-elimination
symbol: sum
hints:
  - "`do { s += i; i++; } while (i < n);` puts the test at the bottom only."
  - There is no leading `b` — the body is entered directly, then the branch
    loops back.
  - "This is the canonical tight loop: body, compare, conditional branch."

# One branch, none wasted

Run a `do { } while ()` and the body always executes **at least once**, which
means the compiler can skip the pre-test entirely. The leading `b test` you saw
in the `for`/`while` shape just *disappears*. You're left with the leanest loop
there is, body then test then a branch back, one conditional jump carrying the
whole thing.

Below, `squares(n)` sums 1 through `n` as a `do`/`while`. No pre-test branch this
time; the body fires straight away and the compare shows up only at the very
bottom:

```asm
li   r4, 1          # i = 1
li   r0, 0          # s = 0
body:
add  r0, r0, r4     # s += i
addi r4, r4, 1      # i++
cmpw r4, r3         # i <= n ?
ble+ body           # only branch in the whole loop
mr   r3, r0
blr
```

The shape is clean enough that MWCC at full `-O4,p` leaves it rolled on its own,
so there's no `#pragma` to add here. Run into a loop with **no pre-test branch at
the top** and you're almost surely looking at a `do`/`while`, or at least a loop
whose author knew the body would always run. And remember `sum` kicks its
induction variable off at 0 rather than 1, which pushes its initializer and test
away from what this example shows.

## Your task

Write `sum` as a `do`/`while` loop. Assume the body always runs at least once.

<!-- starter -->
```c
int sum(int n) {
    int i = 0, s = 0;
    // use a do/while loop
    return s;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
int sum(int n) {
    int i = 0, s = 0;
    do {
        s += i;
        i++;
    } while (i < n);
    return s;
}
```
