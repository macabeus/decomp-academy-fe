title: Floats Use Their Own Registers
difficulty: 1
concepts:
  - calling-convention
  - floating-point
  - registers
symbol: fadd3
hints:
  - Float arguments arrive in f1, f2, f3; the float result returns in f1.
  - Single-precision add is `fadds`; expect two of them, ending in f1.

# A separate file for floating point

Floats don't borrow the `r3`–`r10` integer registers; they get a bank of their
own. The first eight `float` or `double` arguments ride in `f1` through `f8`, and a
floating-point result comes back in `f1`.

For single-precision `f32` work, you want the `...s` ("single") forms of the
instructions. Subtract one `f32` from another, say, and it collapses to a lone
`fsubs`:

```asm
fsubs  f1,f1,f2
blr
```

That's `fsub2(f32 a, f32 b) { return a - b; }`. The difference ends up right in
`f1`, the float return register, the float-side counterpart to `r3`.

Add a third `f32` and `f3` carries it. Now there are two operations to do, so the
compiler grabs a scratch register to hold the intermediate, and the one it reaches
for first is `f0`, which is caller-saved. Two instructions later, the final value
is back in `f1`.

The target for `fadd3` is two `fadds` in a row. Follow the registers through both
to see which operands each one folds together, and what single C expression would
compile down to that pair.

## Your task

Write `fadd3`, taking three `f32`s, to match the target assembly.

<!-- starter -->
```c
f32 fadd3(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c) {
    return 0.0f;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
f32 fadd3(f32 a, f32 b, f32 c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
```
