title: Float Literals Become Pooled Constants
difficulty: 3
concepts:
  - globals
  - sda21
  - literal-pool
  - lfs
  - constants
symbol: scaleHalf
hints:
  - A float literal is pooled into small data under a synthetic label and loaded
    with `lfs`.
  - "`x * 0.5f` becomes `lfs f0, @N@sda21` then `fmuls f1, f0, f1`."

# Where does `0.5f` come from?

PowerPC has no load-immediate-float instruction, so a literal like `0.5f` can't
ride along inside the encoding. MWCC's workaround is to stash it as an anonymous
**pooled constant** in small data and load it with `lfs`, exactly the way it
would load a named global. The one difference is the symbol. Instead of a name
you chose, you get a compiler-minted label like `@5`:

```asm
lfs   f0, @5@sda21(r2)   # load the pooled constant 0.5f
fmuls f1, f0, f1         # x * 0.5f
blr
```
```
R_PPC_EMB_SDA21   @5
```

An `@5` symbol relocated through `R_PPC_EMB_SDA21` is a **literal pool** load. The
machinery is the same as a global float read, and the only thing giving away that
it's a literal rather than something you named is that synthetic `@N` symbol. So
when an `lfs` of an `@N` symbol feeds straight into an arithmetic op, you know the
source expression carried a float constant.

## Your task

Write `scaleHalf`, taking an `f32 x`, to reproduce the `lfs`/`fmuls` sequence
above. Pay close attention to literal suffixes — writing a plain `double` literal
instead of an `f32` one causes MWCC to promote `x` to double precision, multiply,
then convert back, producing `lfd`/`fmul`/`frsp` instead of `lfs`/`fmuls`.
Forgetting the suffix is one of the most common real-world causes of a float
mismatch.

<!-- starter -->
```c
f32 scaleHalf(f32 x) {
    return 0.0f;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
f32 scaleHalf(f32 x) {
    return x * 0.5f;
}
```
