title: "Index an Array, Narrow the Result"
difficulty: 4
concepts:
  - globals
  - array
  - addr16
  - lwzx
  - clrlwi
  - chaining
symbol: lookupByte
hints:
  - The array read is the familiar @ha/@l base, scaled index, and lwzx; the
    narrowing happens *after* the load.
  - "A `(u8)` cast of a value already in a register is a `clrlwi rD, rA, 24` -
    clear the top 24 bits, keep the low byte."

# Casting after an indexed load

A cast like `(u8)tbl[i]` doesn't touch the load at all. You still pull a full
word with `lwzx`, because the array elements are `int`. What the cast does, it
does later, once the word is sitting in `r0`, with no second trip to memory. The
narrowing is one instruction, `clrlwi rD, rA, 24`, clearing the top 24 bits and
keeping the low 8. There's your `(u8)`.

Compare that to a *byte global*, where `lbz` would just fetch the byte. No such
luck with word storage. You read all 32 bits and then mask the top ones, which is
exactly what `lwzx` then `clrlwi ..., 24` is doing: an int element trimmed down to
a byte. Same idea for `(u16)`, only the count becomes `16`. For a signed narrow
you'd reach for `extsb` or `extsh`.

Here's `channel(k)`. It pulls element `k` out of the int array `gPixels` and
returns it as a `u8`:

```asm
lis   r4, gPixels@ha    # high half of &gPixels
slwi  r0, r3, 2         # k * 4
addi  r3, r4, gPixels@l # r3 = &gPixels
lwzx  r0, r3, r0        # r0 = gPixels[k]   (a full int)
clrlwi r3, r0, 24       # r3 = r0 & 0xFF    (the (u8) cast)
blr
```

The first four lines are the plain indexed read. Only the trailing `clrlwi ...,
24` narrows anything. Your target hits a different array but narrows to the same
width, so count the bits in its `clrlwi` to confirm the cast.

## Your task

`extern int gTable[];` is provided. Write `lookupByte`, taking an `int i` and
returning a `u8`, to reproduce the assembly above.

<!-- starter -->
```c
u8 lookupByte(int i) {
    return 0;
}
```

<!-- solution -->
```c
u8 lookupByte(int i) {
    return (u8)gTable[i];
}
```

<!-- context -->
```c
extern int gTable[];
```
